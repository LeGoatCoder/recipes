    "# âš¡ Using the Spark Connector for Weaviate\n",
    "Welcome to this recipe notebook! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk you through a small example of how to take data from a Spark DataFrame and feed it into Weaviate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Environment and Dependencies\n",
    "To ensure smooth execution and prevent potential conflicts with your global Python environment, we recommend running the code in a virtual environment. Later in this notebook, we'll guide you through setting up this environment and installing the necessary dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "Before proceeding with the notebook content, it's essential to set up an isolated Python environment. This helps avoid any potential package conflicts and ensures that you have a clean workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will also need Java 8+ and Scala 2.12 installed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual Environment Setup:\n",
    "If you haven't created a virtual environment before, here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `virtualenv`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install virtualenv\n",
    "python -m virtualenv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `venv` (built-in with Python 3.3+):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ".\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "macOS and Linux:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Dependencies:\n",
    "With the virtual environment active, run the following code to install all the required dependencies for this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that you will also need Java 8+ and Scala 2.12 installed.**"
