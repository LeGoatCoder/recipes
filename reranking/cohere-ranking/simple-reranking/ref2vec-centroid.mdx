# Title: What is Ref2Vec and why you need it for your recommendation system

# Weaviate 1.16 introduced the Ref2Vec module. This article gives an overview of what Ref2Vec is and some examples in which it can add value such as recommendations or representing long objects.

# What is Ref2Vec?
# The name Ref2Vec is short for reference-to-vector, and it offers the ability to vectorize a data object with its cross-references to other objects. The Ref2Vec module currently holds the name ref2vec-**centroid** because it uses the average, or centroid vector, of the cross-referenced vectors to represent the **referencing** object.

# Example of Ref2Vec in a Weaviate database containing User and Product classes of objects to produce recommendations.
# Here, the Product class may include various types of vectorized items, such as shoes, or clothing, and a User could be vectorized by its relationships to Product instances.
# So a User who has liked 3 shoe Product instances will be represented as the average vector of the 3 shoe Product vectors, whereas another User might be represented by an average vector of whatever Product instances that they liked.

# The following image depicts how Ref2Vec aggregates the representations of 3 Product items to represent a User who has purchased a pair of boots, shorts, and Weaviate t-shirt!

# Such a representation of the User, by an aggregation of their cross-references, allows Weaviate to conveniently and immediately learn from each User's preferences and actions to provide improved and up-to-date characterizations.

# Ref2Vec can capture each User's interests and tendencies across multiple axes, such as product categories or even fashion styles! And by doing so, the resulting recommendations can more closely match the User's product and style preferences.

# Recommendation in Weaviate
# Weaviate can power high-quality, lightning-fast recommendations. This is because Recommendation is a very similar task to Search from the perspective of a vector database.
# With Ref2Vec, this task is made easier by representing a user's interests by drawing a graph of cross-references from the user to objects the user has engaged with.
# This gives Weaviate unique points of reference for each user that can be used to rank the search results.

# Ref2Vec gives Weaviate another way to vectorize a class, such as the User class, based on their relationships to other classes.
# This allows Weaviate to quickly create up-to-date representations of users based on their relationships such as recent interactions.

# Representing long objects
# One of the most outstanding problems in Search technology is finding suitable representations for long objects.
# Weaviate already offers a solution to represent long documents with Cross-References!
# However, what if we are searching through Scientific Papers, Legal contracts, or Screenplays such that we need to make long-range references between the Paragraphs?
# In this case, Ref2Vec can be used to average the vectors that represent each Paragraph to form the representation of the referencing Article Class.

# We are very excited about the potential of Ref2Vec, and how it leverages existing symbolic data to augment vector searches in a new way.
# Weaviate is a database that supports data structures like inverted index structures of categorical properties and can integrate symbolic properties such as "colour" in the HNSW vector search algorithm to enable more efficient and guided search.
# Ref2Vec-Centroid goes some way to harness the joint power of vector search combined with relational structure, by making it easier to derive object vectors from relationships.

# We have another blog post coming soon on the development directions of Ref2Vec for the future.
# We will discuss topics such as collaborative filtering, multiple centroids, graph neural networks, and more on re-ranking with Ref2Vec. Stay tuned!
