# The hybrid search algorithm calculates a weighted score for each object using both result sets
# The weights are determined by the `alpha` parameter

# By default, the `rankedFusion` algorithm is used
# It calculates the score for each object according to its position in the results for the given search
# The total score is calculated by adding these rank-based scores from the vector and keyword searches

# A newer algorithm, `relativeScoreFusion`, was added in Weaviate version 1.20
# It derives each objects score by normalizing the metrics output by the vector search and keyword search respectively
# The highest value becomes 1, the lowest value becomes 0, and others end up in between according to this scale
# The total score is thus calculated by a scaled sum of normalized vector similarity and normalized BM25 score

# The choice of algorithm can significantly impact the results of the hybrid search
# The `relativeScoreFusion` algorithm has been shown to improve recall by ~6% over the default `rankedFusion` method
# It also tends to produce more natural clusters of objects, which can be useful for features like AutoCut

# However, the default choice of `rankedFusion` is a reliable and well-tested option
# The community's feedback on `relativeScoreFusion` is currently being evaluated, and additional feedback is encouraged

# Hybrid search in Weaviate offers a powerful blend of vector and keyword search
# It delivers semantically rich results while respecting precision of keyword searches
# The introduction of `relativeScoreFusion` expands Weaviateâ€™s hybrid search capabilities
# Users are invited to dive in, experiment with these fusion algorithms, and share their experiences
