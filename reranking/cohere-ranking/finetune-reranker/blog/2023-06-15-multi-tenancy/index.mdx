<!-- Large-scale setups were always a great reason to choose Weaviate. Last year we wrote about the first time [a Weaviate setup ran with a billion objects & vectors](/blog/sphere-dataset-in-weaviate). What was a mere experiment back then is a regular production case today. But earlier this year, we saw a shift in usage patterns: As we onboarded more and more large-scale and enterprise users, the definition of scale shifted from the number of vectors to the number of individual tenants that can run on a single setup. -->
**Large-scale setups were always a great reason to choose Weaviate.** In the past, we have written about how Weaviate can handle a billion objects and vectors. However, we have seen a shift in usage patterns, and the definition of scale has changed from the number of vectors to the number of individual tenants that can run on a single setup.

<!--- Previously, Weaviate offered multiple ways to tackle multi-tenancy, but none were intended for a massive scale. Weaviate `v1.20` - coming in July 2023 - changes this once and for all: Native multi-tenancy support that scales to millions of tenants with 10s of thousands of active tenants per node. Yet scale is not the only point that makes the new multi-tenancy feature great; we put a lot of emphasis on compliance and a smooth UX. GDPR-compliant deletes with one command are just one of the many features. Let me walk you through what’s coming in the next Weaviate release and show you why I’m incredibly excited about this one. -->

## The need for multi-tenancy

<!--- We define multi-tenancy as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application. Imagine a fictional company called ACME Accounting Group that offers online accounting services that use AI to make accounting easy and fun. The company has over one million customers. Each customer is a company that can have many users and even more documents. Alice, who works for AliceCorp, should never be able to see the accounting information of Bob, who works for BobInc. Therefore, AliceCorp and BobInc are tenants from the perspective of ACME Accounting. Besides access isolation, ACME Accounting has other requirements for a multi-tenancy setup: -->
**We define multi-tenancy as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application.** Let’s take the example of a fictional company called ACME Accounting Group that offers online accounting services that use AI to make accounting easy and fun. The company has over one million customers, and each customer is a company that can have many users and even more documents. Alice, who works for AliceCorp, should never be able to see the accounting information of Bob, who works for BobInc. Therefore, AliceCorp and BobInc are tenants from the perspective of ACME Accounting. Besides access isolation, ACME Accounting has other requirements for a multi-tenancy setup:

* **Speed**: With millions of tenants, narrowing a request down to a single tenant should not take much work.
* **Easy on and offboarding**: Just because ACME Accounting already has a million customers doesn’t mean that adding your business to ACME should take a considerable computational load. If AliceCorp cancels its contract, this should not affect other tenants.
* **Resource boundaries**: If members of BobInc all get together to produce their annual report, this can put a lot of load onto ACME’s system. This should not interfere with AliceCorp, which might also have essential accounting deadlines.
* **Cost-efficiency**: With usage peaking around tax season but most tenants inactive for many days of the month, ACME shouldn’t have to pay for a large setup that is essentially idle most of the time.
* **Diversity of tenants**: ACME has both large and small customers. Their setup needs to be able to handle tenants of vastly different sizes. While most tenants are small, a few tenants can make up a large bulk of the data.

## A time before multi-tenancy support

<!--- Before Weaviate `v1.20`, you had two options to model a multi-tenancy landscape. Both had considerable drawbacks which made us completely rethink multi-tenancy: -->

### Using Classes

<!--- Classes were already isolation units within Weaviate, so you were already halfway there: Good isolation, easy deletes, and no filter required to scope a request to a tenant. However, there was one major problem: With classes, it was incredibly difficult to run with more than 5 to 10,000 tenants. Workarounds were needed to make it scale further, and there was a lot of duplication in the schema. -->
