## Group by arbitrary property

With this release, you can now group `Get` search results based on a specific property. This functionality allows you to search through detailed or segmented objects (e.g., `Passage`) while also enabling you to view the broader context of the objects (e.g., `Document`).

## New (or improved) Data Types

We've made several enhancements to the way we handle data, including upgrades to the `text` property and the introduction of dedicated `uuid` data types.

### Text / String changes

We have upgraded the `text` property to offer more flexibility in tokenizing textual data for indexing. You can now choose from `word`, `whitespace`, `lowercase`, and `field` tokenization options. To simplify matters, we have deprecated the `string` data type.

The available tokenization options for `text` are:

-   `word` (default): Keep alpha-numeric characters, lowercase them, and split by whitespace. _(Same as the current `text` behavior.)_
-   `whitespace`: Split the text on whitespace. _(Same as `word` on `string` right now.)_
-   `lowercase`: Lowercase the text and split on whitespace. _(New)_
-   `field`: Index the whole field after trimming whitespace characters. _(Same as the current `string` behavior.)_

#### Faster filtering & index changes

We have introduced a roaring bitmap index for `text` properties, which brings the fast filtering capabilities introduced in version `1.18` to text data. Internally, this is implemented using two separate (`filterable` & `searchable`) indexes, which replaces the existing index. You can configure the new `indexFilterable` and `indexSearchable` parameters to determine whether to create the roaring set index and the BM25-suitable
