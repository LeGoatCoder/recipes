## Intro

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has enabled computers to understand the human language, shifting the way humans build and interact with computers. Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin the latest developments in NLP and have gained traction in various applications. [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) is an AI platform that provides its users with access to its LLMs, giving developers and businesses the ability to implement NLP as part of their toolkit.
