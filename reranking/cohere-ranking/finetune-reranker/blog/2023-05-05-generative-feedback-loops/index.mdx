<!--- This is a brief history of the information technology revolution leading up to the advent of LLMs -->
Large Language Models (LLMs) are heralding a new era in information technology. To better understand this revolution, it’s important to consider the historical context. The printing press significantly reduced the cost of reproducing information, while the internet cut out the middleman, making the distribution of information virtually free. [In Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/), Ben Thompson writes about how the free distribution of the internet allowed companies to modularize (or unbundle) services and focus on user experience. Ben states that “companies that win the user experience can generate a virtuous cycle where their ownership of consumers/users attracts suppliers which improves the user experience”.

<!--- This is a description of how LLMs can expedite the virtuous cycle described in Aggregation Theory -->
Enter Large Language Models (LLMs), a world changing technology that enables transforming and generating information at incredible speeds and low cost. **LLMs present the opportunity to expedite the virtuous cycle Aggregation Theory describes by commoditizing the human effort traditionally required to deliver great user experiences.**

<!--- This is a description of how LLMs can be used to modify and generate content based on user preferences -->
The internet cut out the newspaper, now content can be delivered directly to you. Now we are going a step further, modifying content itself based on your personal preferences! Not only are we able to bring content with a great UX to people, but now we can generate content, in real time, based on existing information in the database to create an ever better and more personalized experience!

<!--- This is an introduction to the concept of Generative Feedback Loops with LLMs in Weaviate -->
In this article, we are going to illustrate the concept of **Generative Feedback Loops with LLMs**. Retrieving information from the Weaviate Vector Database to prompt Weaviate’s generative module and then vectorizing and saving these generations **back** into the database! Now we can semantically search through the generated content, as well as add symbolic metadata about it.

<!--- This is an example of how LLMs can be used to create custom advertisements for AirBnB listings based on user preferences -->
We will step into the shoes of AirBnB and implement a Generative Feedback Loop to process `Listing` objects. This shows how LLMs let us supercharge user experience by creating custom advertisements based on user preferences. We retrieve information about users from the DB, give that + information about the Listing to the LLM, and save the resulting custom advertisement back to the database.

<!--- This is a quick overview of the code snippets that will be covered in the article -->
Here is a quick overview of the code snippets before diving in:
1. Create a description for Listings based on x,y,z.
2. Semantic Search through generated Listings with the [Vector Database](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database)
3. Generate Ads for these Listings and link them with cross-references.
4. Write personalized Ads for Connor the dog owner and Bob the weightlifter

The Github repo with notebooks (using Weaviate embedded) can be found [here](https://github.com/weaviate/Generative-Feedback-Loops/).

<!--- This is a code block that sets up the Weaviate client and checks which modules are enabled -->
In this example we will be using the OpenAI `text-davinci-003` and the Cohere `command-xlarge-nightly` LLMs to generate content, but this is also possible with other providers such as HuggingFace, Anthropic, and more. Set your OpenAI or Cohere key to use with Weaviate’s generate module using the following block of code:




<!--- This is a table that illustrates the schema of the data that will be used -->
The table below illustrates the schema of the data we will use, please see the notebook for reference of the full json dictionary to create Weaviate schemas with configurations like this:
