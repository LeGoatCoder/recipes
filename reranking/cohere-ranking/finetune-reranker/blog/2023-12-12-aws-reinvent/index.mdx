# Weaviate’s re:Invent 2023 Recap

This November, the Weaviate team attended Amazon re:Invent for the first time! The conference hosted over 50,000 people from around the world to learn about the latest developments in cloud technology and share their projects with the AWS developer community. In this post, we will recap our highlights from the event.

## GenAI is (still) heating up

The focus theme of this year's re:Invent was Generative AI, and it was a popular topic in the sessions our team attended. In particular, there was a strong emphasis on [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://weaviate.io/blog/rag-evaluation).

On the first day, approximately 40% of the people who visited our booth were familiar with RAG. By the last day, nearly everyone who talked to us knew what it was because so many different sessions had covered the topic.

We received a lot of positive feedback on our open-source RAG app, Verba, which we used to demonstrate Weaviate. It’s a tool you can use to quickly build RAG apps that fit your use case. Check out [our intro video](https://youtu.be/IiNDCPwmqF8?si=cZxfsnY6vW75c4BD) or dive right in to [our GitHub repo](https://youtu.be/IiNDCPwmqF8?si=cZxfsnY6vW75c4BD)!

We enjoyed hearing about the different use cases and industries in which folks are building AI apps, including chatbots and search applications for customer support, document search, image search, and even video search. A common pattern we saw was that organizations of all sizes are evaluating vector database platforms and want guidance on how to find the right database for them.

One of our recommendations is to look for a vector database purpose-built for AI. These databases (like Weaviate) were created specifically to store, manage, and retrieve vector embeddings, and do so faster and more efficiently than traditional databases. While vector search is becoming a popular offering in the database world, many “latched on” solutions don’t meet the requirements of modern AI-native development, from reduced developer experience to problems with speed and accuracy.

## The market is confusing

The AI space is moving fast, and with so many new technologies and vendors, it’s no wonder re:Invent attendees were telling us that they were getting overwhelmed with the options.

Luckily, your friendly neighborhood Weaviate crew is here to help. Check out one of our free weekly workshops to help you understand what vector databases are and how they can help you build production-ready AI apps quickly and easily.

If you’re curious, here are some of the most commonly asked questions we encountered:

### What’s the difference between a vector database and a graph or relational database?

Graph databases are used to identify relationships between objects, and vector databases are used to find objects. Relational databases store the relations between tables and build indexes for the fast lookup of joined tables. Vector databases, on the other hand, store the embeddings of structured and unstructured data for the quick retrieval of the objects.

### What features does Weaviate offer to help me protect data privacy?

Weaviate is designed with robust security measures to ensure it meets the requirements of enterprise environments. Weaviate has achieved SOC 2 certification and is encrypted in transit and at rest. In addition, our code undergoes constant security scanning and we conduct regular penetration testing, ensuring our defenses are always up to date against evolving security threats.

Since Weaviate is open-source technology that can be installed in any environment, it enables customers to keep all data locally, without having to send to a third party over the internet.

### How does Weaviate compare to AWS?

Weaviate and AWS compliment each other nicely. You can use Weaviate as your vector database with Amazon Bedrock. Start building with the [`text2vec-aws` module](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-aws) today!

### What sets Weaviate apart from other vector databases?

Weaviate is an open-source vector database, built from the ground up for vector search. This means we deliver best-in-class features including:

- **Native multi-tenancy support**: ensure your users’ data doesn’t merge together.
- **Built-in hybrid search**: customize the weighting of the bm25 and vector search method with the `alpha` value.
- **Robust integration library**: connect Weaviate to your AI stack of choice including providers like Amazon Sagemaker, OpenAI, Cohere, and Hugging Face through our modular architecture.
- **Flexible deployment options**: run Weaviate locally or as a managed service (Serverless, Enterprise Dedicated, or Bring Your Own Cloud) depending on your business needs.
