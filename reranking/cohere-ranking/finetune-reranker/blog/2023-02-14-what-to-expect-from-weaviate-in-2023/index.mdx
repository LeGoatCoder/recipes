Comments:

* Introduction to the six pillars outlining how Weaviate will get even better in 2023
* Weaviate development is highly dynamic and the company and product have grown tremendously in 2022
* Weaviate usage numbers are through the roof and the company is working on improving the product based on user feedback and requests

In 2023, we will focus on six key areas to make Weaviate even better:

## 1. Ingestion and Search Pipelines

Weaviate's strong and growing module ecosystem gives you flexibility in how you use the product. In early 2023, we added the `generative-openai` module and we want to give you even more flexibility in combining these steps. This includes controlling arbitrary querying steps through the proposed Pipe API and giving you more flexibility during ingestion time, such as extracting PDFs or applying stemming to your BM25 and hybrid search.

Comments:

* Explanation of the first pillar: improving the ingestion and search pipelines
* Weaviate has a strong and growing module ecosystem that gives users flexibility
* Introduction of the proposed Pipe API and improvements to ingestion time flexibility

## 2. Beyond Billion Scale: Large-Scale Performance

In 2022, we published the Sphere Demo Dataset for Weaviate, which marked the first time (to our knowledge) that more than a billion objects and vectors were imported into Weaviate. This pillar is all about performance and the move towards a Native Roaring Bitmap Index, which can speed up filtered vector search by a factor of 1000. We are also thinking about the next steps for even faster aggregations and new types of specialized indexes.

Comments:

* Explanation of the second pillar: improving performance for large-scale datasets
* Introduction of the Native Roaring Bitmap Index and its potential to speed up filtered vector search
* Discussion of future plans for even faster aggregations and specialized indexes

## 3. Cloud Operations & Scaling

When we introduced Replication to Weaviate in late 2022, we celebrated a significant milestone. 2023 is all about improving your cloud and operations experience. We will give you more control over how to structure your workloads in a distributed setup and more flexibility to adapt to your ever-changing needs. We are also constantly working on making your distributed cluster even more resilient.

Comments:

* Explanation of the third pillar: improving cloud operations and scaling
* Introduction of Replication and plans to improve the cloud and operations experience
* Discussion of efforts to increase flexibility and resilience in distributed clusters

## 4. New Vector Indexes

Last year we gave you a sneak peek into our Vector Indexing Research, and this year you will be able to try out new vector indexes for yourself. We will offer you not just one but two memory-saving options to index your vectors without sacrificing latency and throughput. In early 2023, you will be able to use Product Quantization, a vector compression algorithm, in Weaviate for the first time. We are also working on a fully disk-based solution which we will release in late 2023.

Comments:

* Explanation of the fourth pillar: introducing new vector indexes
* Discussion of the company's vector indexing research and plans to offer new memory-saving options
* Introduction of Product Quantization and plans for a fully disk-based solution

## 5. Improving our Client and Module Ecosystem

So far, we have only discussed features related to Weaviate Core, the server in your setup. But the Weaviate experience is more than that. Modules allow you to integrate seamlessly with various embedding providers, and our language clients make Weaviate accessible right from your application. This year, we will further improve both. This includes improved APIs on the client side, new modules, for example, for generative search, and improvements to our existing modules.

Comments:

* Explanation of the fifth pillar: improving the client and module ecosystem
* Discussion of plans to improve the APIs, modules, and language clients for Weaviate

## 6. Community

The most important pillar is all of you â€“ our community. This includes both free, open-source users that self-host their Weaviate setup, as well as paid enterprise users and anyone using our Weaviate-as-a-Service offerings. We value your feedback and love that you are part of shaping our future.

Comments:

* Explanation of the sixth pillar: the importance of the Weaviate community
* Discussion of the value placed on user feedback and the role of the community in shaping the future of Weaviate

In conclusion, the company is proud of the growth and achievements of the past year and is excited about the future. Thank you to the team and the community for your contributions.
