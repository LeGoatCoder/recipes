[Vector databases](/blog/what-is-a-vector-database) - like [Weaviate](/developers/weaviate) - use **machine learning models** to analyze data and **calculate vector embeddings**. The vector embeddings are **stored together with the data** in a database, and later are used to query the data.

In a nutshell, a vector embedding is an array of numbers, that is used to describe an object. For example, strawberries could have a vector `[3, 0, 1]` – more likely the array would be a lot longer than that.
