![Monitoring Weaviate in Production](./img/hero.png)

<!--- truncate -->

Weaviate is designed to be easy to monitor and observe by following a cloud native approach. To do this Weaviate supports the following features:

1. Publishing of Prometheus metrics to the standard `/metrics` endpoint

2. Use of built-in Kubernetes [liveness and readiness](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/well-known) checks

3. Configuration of settings via environment variables

4. Simplified deployment via [helm charts](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-helm)

There is existing documentation on [the exported metrics](/developers/weaviate/configuration/monitoring) which also has [an example](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples/tree/main/monitoring-prometheus-grafana) for how to use a Prometheus instance for metrics.

<!--- Question: How can I integrate Weaviate with my existing observability stack? --->

This article describes two approaches using either Grafana agent or Datadog agent to scrape these metrics. It also provides a list of important metrics to monitor.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you have already deployed Weaviate. By default Prometheus monitoring is disabled, so you can enable it with this environment setting:




Weaviate will then publish Prometheus metrics on port `2112`.

<!--- Note: If you are using Weaviate `1.17` or lower, you may want to upgrade to `1.18` before enabling Prometheus metrics. The reason being Weaviate previously published many histograms which has since been [replaced](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/releases/tag/v1.18.0) by summaries for performance reasons. Additionally, be careful enabling Prometheus metrics if you have many thousands of classes as you may end up with high cardinality labels due to some metrics being produced per class. --->

## Grafana Agent

<!--- Image: monitoring weaviate in production --->

For the first approach we will use the open-source [Grafana agent](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/). In this case, we will show writing to Grafana Cloud for hosted metrics. This is configurable via the remote write section if you alternatively want to write to a self-hosted Mimir or Prometheus instance.

### Steps to Install

1. Install Grafana agent in your target environment following the [set-up guide](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/).

2. Configure the Grafana `agent.yaml` to include a scrape job called `weaviate`.




3. Validate that you are receiving data by going to explore and running the following PromQL query in Grafana.




### Dashboards

One benefit of this approach is that you can now reuse the existing Weaviate Grafana dashboards.

Steps to import these dashboards:

1. Download and import the [preexisting dashboards](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/tree/master/tools/dev/grafana/dashboards).

2. If you're using Grafana Cloud hosted Prometheus you will need to patch the dashboards to change the datasource uid to be `grafanacloud-prom` as below.




The dashboards should now be visible!

## Datadog

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is another popular solution for observability, and the Datadog agent has support for scraping Prometheus metrics.

### Steps to Install

1. Install the datadog agent. For this example, installation was done using their [Helm](https://docs.datadoghq.com/containers/kubernetes/installation/?tab=helm) charts.

2. Provide a `datadog-values.yml` config including the below. You can also capture Weaviate logs using the method.
