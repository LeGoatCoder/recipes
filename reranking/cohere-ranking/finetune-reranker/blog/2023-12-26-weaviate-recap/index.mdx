Itâ€™s hard to imagine that less than a year ago, so very few people even knew about the concept of vector databases and how AI could benefit from them. # (Introduction)

Meanwhile, curiosity and interest in AI spiked, especially after OpenAI launched ChatGPT. Curiosity has sped up our progress and made more people aware of the opportunities AI offers, transforming our landscape. Let's all take a moment to reflect and appreciate the start of a momentous change in how we can communicate, learn, teach, and collaborate so much faster and more effectively by leveraging AI.

## Exploring the Power of Vector Databases # (Section - exploring the power of vector databases)

The year 2023 was all about dynamic experimentation at Weaviate. Vector databases became a strong and recognized foundation in building ever more effective AI applications, enabling **chatbots,** **agents,** and **advanced** **search systems.**

### Online Hackathons # (Sub-section - online hackathons)

Our 2023 global online hackathons proved to be vibrant innovation hubs, fostering diversity and inclusion in collaborative work. We teamed up with friends from [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [AutoGPT](https://autogpt.net/), [lablab.ai](https://lablab.ai/), [SuperAGI](https://superagi.com/), and many others.

## Building with Weaviate # (Section - building with weaviate)

In the realm of Generative AI, especially with the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT, the technology landscape has had a significant impact. Users began experimenting with ChatGPT early in the year. They discovered the influence of prompt phrasing on responses, leading to a growing interest in "prompt engineering" and its best practices within the AI community. The emphasis on scalable, open-source vector databases to manage data from AI models aligns perfectly with the goal of making generative AI accessible to all.

### In-house open source projects # (Sub-section - in-house open source projects)

Our in-house projects, [Verba, an open-source RAG app](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba) and [Health Search](https://github.com/weaviate/healthsearch-demo) built by [Edward Schmuhl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardschmuhl/), and other projects like [Leonie Monigatti's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/804250ab/) [Awesome-Moviate](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/awesome-moviate) and [Adam Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itsajchan/)'s [Recommendation System](https://github.com/itsajchan/Create-JSON-Data-with-AI) have pushed the boundaries of what's possible with vector databases applicable to different industry use cases.

### Community projects # (Sub-section - community projects)

Incredible projects came to life through Weaviate in 2023! One standout project is [Basepilot](https://www.basepilot.com/), a project by [Ken Hendricks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-hendricks-96181611a/) and [Pascal Wieler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascal-wieler/) that enables businesses to create their own product copilots easily. Their embedded copilot allows product users to find information and get tasks done just by chatting to it.

During the Anthropic Hackathon in London, Ken and Pascal built the v1 version of their product. At the hackathon, they developed a support copilot capable of answering any user queries about a product or API. What's impressive is that it can be easily integrated into any website with just a single line of code. Now, their copilots provide answers and execute actions for users.
