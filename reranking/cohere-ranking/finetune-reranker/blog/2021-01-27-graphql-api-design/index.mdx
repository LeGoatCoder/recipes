![How Weaviate's GraphQL API was designed](./img/hero.png)

<!---
Choosing a good API, its design and development, is a crucial but time-consuming process, especially if you want to develop one in an ongoing software development project.
--->

Weaviate uses the API query language [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). GraphQL enables efficient development and provides high user experience (UX) for data interaction.

<!---
In this article we explain how the use of GraphQL leverages the UX of Weaviate, and how we approach the design of this API.
--->

In the following sections, we will discuss:

1. Introduction to Weaviate and its need for an API
2. Overview of GraphQL and why Weaviate uses it
3. Designing Weaviate's GraphQL API with a human-centered approach
4. Iterative prototyping and feedback process
5. Conclusion and further resources

## What is Weaviate and why does it need an API?
Weaviate is an [open-source](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) Vector Database: for understandable knowledge representation, enabling semantic search and automatic classification. Weaviate does not only store data, but also its (automatically derived) context, consisting of linguistic information and relations to other concepts. The result is a network of knowledge, or a graph of data.

One core question is: How do we interact with this new type of data storage? Interacting with big data, enriched with contextual information, might sound even more overwhelming than interacting with a traditional, relational database.

Data needs to be added, retrieved and manipulated, all controlled by the user but enabled by the underlying database interface. Here's where APIs jump in. Because of Weaviate's graph-based architecture, an alternative to traditional RESTful APIs was what we were looking for.

### What is GraphQL, and why does Weaviate use it?

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an API query language, which was open-sourced by Facebook in 2012 and currently maintained by the Linux Foundation. The core strength of GraphQL is that the client is fully in control of what data is returned. This means that over-fetching is never a problem and the need for multiple requests is removed. In addition, using GraphQL allows fast API development and easy API evolvement over time, because of its powerful development tools and single evolving versioning.

All in all, many reasons to adopt GraphQL for the graph-like structure of Weaviate. GraphQL seems the perfect solution for intuitive database interaction and efficient development. Weaviate still uses traditional RESTful endpoints (using OpenAPI/Swagger) to add data, but the main interaction for data consumption goes via GraphQL.

<!---
GraphQL still follows the same constraints as REST APIs, but data is organized into a graph using only one interface. Thus instead of endpoints, the API is organized in terms of types and fields. The fields of interest are specified by the client, chosen from a schema defined by the server. This requires a well formulated schema. Let's dive into how we approach the design of Weaviate's GraphQL API.

### Human-Centered API Design

So, how does our GraphQL design, development and implementation cycle look like? We approach this very carefully, since we are talking about a design for end-users, made by developers, two sides that differ in many ways. Instead of a data-driven approach, we took a user point of view. Humans tend to talk in interactions; we ask questions when we want to retrieve something, and use verbs or even commands if we want someone or something to do something for us. So why not also apply the same behaviour to interaction with data?

Try to think about what you would want to get out of the database in different use cases (as a user), and how this could be done most efficiently. What naturally follows is the words that are frequently used in these interactions. We used these words in the design of our GraphQL schema.

<!---
Let's look at an example. Consider you (digitally) store supermarket items in Weaviate, and now want to know which items are low in storage. This could be achieved by the following query:
--->

#### Example: Querying Low Stock Items

Let's say you store supermarket items in Weaviate and want to know which items are low in storage. You can use the following GraphQL query:




This query may return:
