Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way we interact and communicate with computers. These machines can understand and generate human-like language on a massive scale. LLMs are a versatile tool that is seen in many applications like chatbots, content creation, and much more. Despite being a powerful tool, LLMs have the drawback of being too general. Fortunately, there are emerging technologies that help solve this limitation.
