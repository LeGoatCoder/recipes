<!-- truncate -->

Maintaining data integrity is one of the key goals for database users. So it should come as no surprise that backing up the data is an important part of database best practices.

Although it has always been possible to back up Weaviate data, doing so used to require many manual and inelegant steps. So, we have introduced a [backup feature](/developers/weaviate/configuration/backups) in Weaviate `v1.15` that streamlines the backup process, whether it be to a **local file system** or to a **cloud storage provider**.

If you have not yet had a chance to use this cool feature, don't worry! This tutorial will show you how to use this feature to back up your data and restore it to another Weaviate instance.

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:
- Spun up two instances of Weaviate,
- Populated one Weaviate instance with a new schema & data,
- Backed up the Weaviate instance, and
- Restored the backup data to the other instance.

## Preparations
To get started, clone [github.com/weaviate-tutorials/weaviate-backup](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/weaviate-backup) repository and spin up Weaviate:




The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) has been set up to spin up two Weaviate instances for this tutorial. You should be able to connect to them at `http://localhost:8080` and `http://localhost:8090` respectively. We'll call them **W1** and **W2** from this point on for convenience.

Think of **W1** as the source instance you want to back up, while **W2** is the destination instance you want to restore the backup to.

### Local backups

The `docker-compose.yml` also specifies the below parameters to enable local backups.



* `ENABLE_MODULES: 'backup-filesystem'` enables the `backup-filesystem` module to back up data from Weaviate to the filesystem.
* `BACKUP_FILESYSTEM_PATH: '/tmp/backups'` sets `/tmp/backups` as the `BACKUP_FILESYSTEM_PATH`, which is the backup path within the Docker container.
* `volumes: - ./backups:/tmp/backups` mounts a volume from outside the container such that Weaviate can save data to it. Setting it to `./backups:/tmp/backups` maps `./backups` on the local device to `/tmp/backups` within the container, so the generated backup data will end up in the `./backups` directory as you will see later on.

Now let's dive into it to see the backup functionality in action!

### Utility scripts
To begin with, both Weaviate instances **W1** and **W2** should be empty. In order to get straight to the point of this tutorial, we've prepared a set of scripts (located in the `scripts` folder) that will help you prepare your Weaviate instances and test them out.


:::note Examples available in other languages
The tutorial text refers to shell scripts (e.g. `0_query_instances.sh`), but we also provide code examples in other languages including **Python** and **JavaScript**. These files are located in `scripts` subdirectory and we encourage you to try them out yourself using your favorite client.
:::

If you run the `0_query_instances.sh` script, you should see that neither instances contain a schema.




If it is not empty, or if at any point you would like to reset your Weaviate instances, you can run the `9_delete_all` script, which will delete all of the existing schema and data at those locations.




### Populate **W1** with data

As our first order of action, we will populate **W1** with data. Run the following to create a schema and import data:




Now, running the `0_query_instances` script will return results showing the `Author` and `Book` classes in the schema as well as the objects. Great! We are ready to get to the main point of this tutorial â€“> back up and restore.




## Back up & restore data
Now let's move on to creating our first backup. Initiating a backup involves just a short bit of code.

The below `curl` command will back up all classes in **W1**, and call the backup `my-very-first-backup`.



:::note The `backup_id` must be unique.
The ID value is used to create a subdirectory in the backup location, and attempting to reuse an existing ID will cause Weaviate to throw an error. Delete the existing directory if one already exists.
