## Overview of ChatGPT plugins

Last week OpenAI announced plugins for ChatGPT and all of a sudden everyone‚Äôs favorite chatbot can now interact with the world of other apps we use in our everyday lives! The plugins announcement is a game-changer, arguably even more important than the 4.0 upgrade to the underlying GPT model itself.

So what are ChatGPT plugins? Some are explaining plugins as the ‚Äúeyes and ears‚Äù of LLMs to help products like ChatGPT interact more naturally with users by knowing of and integrating with other apps such as Zapier, Uber Eats, Duolingo, and many more. I would argue that plugins are much more than just the ‚Äúeyes and ears‚Äù of ChatGPT.  Hear me out.

Until now ChatGPT was a tool that we could converse with and it would ‚Äúimagine‚Äù creative stories, help us learn, summarize for us, write for us, and explain to us. The interface ChatGPT could use to interact with us was limited to a tab on our browser. But now, imbued with the power of plugins, ChatGPT can actually do much more than just ‚Äútalk‚Äù, it can actually ‚Äúdo‚Äù things in the real world!

For example, if you have the Instacart plugin enabled, not only can you ask ChatGPT to generate recipes, but also order groceries to be delivered to your door to help put together your next meal! Or if you don't feel like cooking, it‚Äôll book you a seat at a restaurant that serves similar food using OpenTable! People were astounded by ChatGPT‚Äôs ability to put together great vacations, but now through plugin integrations with Expedia, it can actually buy your tickets for you, book your hotels and even book you a ride to and from the airport! Though we can still only interact with ChatGPT through a tab on our browser, it can now interact with us through any one of the thousands of integrations, from Google Sheets to Salesforce, that the [Zapier plugin](https://zapier.com/blog/announcing-zapier-chatgpt-plugin/) connects to.

In short, plugins give ChatGPT the ability to leverage third-party resources to act upon the conversations that you have with it! Not only can ChatGPT call upon the wealth of Apps currently available to actually perform and impact things in the real world but also use the strengths of this App network to make up for some of its own shortcomings.

What we‚Äôre most excited about is **the Retrieval Plugin**, which allows you to use ChatGPT with a [Vector Database](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database) like Weaviate to overcome one of the biggest challenges that ChatGPT has struggled with: its lack of long-term memory, as well as its inability to provide responses based on internal documents and data. üß†üîå

This has the potential to be the most widely used plugin as it will allow users to create customized versions of ChatGPT catered to their own data. Don‚Äôt just take it from me, take it [from Greg](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1640006228930867200), the Co-founder of OpenAI and the fact that the plugin was trending on Github!

## The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin

The [ChatGPT retrieval plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin) allows you to connect ChatGPT to an instance of a [vector database](/developers/weaviate). Anything stored in a connected vector database can then be used to answer questions to prompts, thus allowing ChatGPT to ‚Äúknow‚Äù your custom data and answer questions based on the details stored in the vector database! Not only that but the vector database can also be used as a *long-term storage* of memory for ChatGPT to persist and store portions of your conversations from the short-lived memory of a tab to the long-term storage capabilities of a vector database. A vector database once connected via the retrieval plugin acts as the cortex of ChatGPT! üß†

The retrieval plugin can be used to get ChatGPT to accomplish tasks grounded in the context of knowledge stored in a connected vector database such as Weaviate. This process consists of two steps: first, we prompt ChatGPT with a question that it uses to craft a query that can be sent to the vector database as demonstrated below.

This is what would happen if you used ChatGPT without the Weaviate Retrieval Plugin.

As expected, the model does not have any specific information with which to answer the question! Now let's say we enable the Weaviate Retrieval Plugin as shown below:
