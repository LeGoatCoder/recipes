:::info Auto-GPT being re-factored
Edit (5/Jun/2023): Auto-GPT has [temporarily removed support for external vector stores as they refactor their code](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/60ac0c4da15930d5e40af87fba6248ec37a951ee/BULLETIN.md?plain=1#L27).

We are working on re-introducing the integration. For now, please use this version (<https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/v0.3.1>) to use Auto-GPT with Weaviate.
:::

Auto-GPT is a popular open-source python project that harnesses the power of GPT-4 to complete various tasks autonomously. It uses a method called "chain of thought" to break down tasks into intermediate steps and complete them iteratively. Auto-GPT can be configured with a list of tools, including a code executor, Google search API, and a calculator. It can also be given access to long-term memory via a vector database, such as Weaviate.

The following is an example of how Auto-GPT works:

User query: "Please write out a grocery list and create a recipe using each ingredient."

Task: Write out a grocery list based on past items

Plan:
1. Use the long-term memory from the Weaviate database to curate the list from last week
2. Order the groceries
3. Use the internet to look up different recipes

Action:
1. View previous grocery lists
2. Order the groceries online
3. Use the internet to gather recipes

Auto-GPT is able to confirm each action was completed and refine its plan based on the results.

People have shared many examples of what they've built with Auto-GPT, such as conducting market research, creating an app, and ordering pizza.

To use Auto-GPT with Weaviate, you need to connect to a vector database and enable the application to retrieve specific data. This is useful if you're asking Auto-GPT to complete a task that it wasn't trained on. Auto-GPT can also save and recall its actions for future use.

Here is the [codebase](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/v0.3.1/autogpt/memory/weaviate.py) to see how Weaviate is integrated in Auto-GPT.

The easiest way to use Weaviate with Auto-GPT is with a WCS instance. Create a Sandbox instance by following [these steps](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart#create-a-weaviate-cluster), and install Auto-GPT using the latest instructions from the repo, with the following notes in mind:

- At the time of writing, it suggested using the [latest stable release](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/releases/latest) only, rather than the `master` branch.
- We recommend running Auto-GPT in a Docker container so that it runs in a safer, sandboxed environment.
- If you intend to run Auto-GPT directly from your device, rather than in a Docker container, we suggest installing the required libraries into a virtual environment, rather than to your system Python.

During installation, edit the below variables in the Auto-GPT `.env` file based on the following:




And then, you can start Auto-GPT. You can run it directly on your device, or within a Docker container. To run it directly, run:




Or run the following to start it within a Docker container:




The above steps will allow Auto-GPT to use the WCS instance as the memory backend, allowing it to store and retrieve information as required.

We note using a local instance of Weaviate with Docker is a little more complicated. You will need to modify the `Docker Compose` file such that the Weaviate container and the Auto-GPT container are able to communicate with each other.

:::caution
Although Auto-GPT is a great project to try, it is best to test it out with caution. It is currently in the experimental phase, so it is best to not use it in production. Additionally, allowing Auto-GPT to run for a long period of time could get very expensive, and keep in mind that it may affect your device. Such as by writing or modifying files, and installing dependencies for example. If your task requires multiple steps, it is best to keep an eye on your OpenAI API usage, such as by setting a limit on your spend. Check out the disclaimer [here](https
