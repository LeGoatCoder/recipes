Title: The History of Weaviate
This article shares the history of Weaviate, including its origins, concept, and future plans.

<!---
## A World of Wonders called Natural Language Processing
This section introduces the concept of word embeddings and how they represent words in a multidimensional hyperspace.
--->

<!---
### Example of an embedding
This subsection provides an example of a word embedding for the word "squarepants".
--->

<!---
This metaphor explains how word embeddings work by comparing them to a supermarket.
--->

<!---
Being able to represent words in a space gives you the ability to calculate with language.
--->

<!---
## How to semantically store data objects
This section discusses the challenge of naming and searching for data objects and how word embeddings can be used to store data semantically.
--->

<!---
Finding more context around a word is called disambiguation.
--->

<!---
This step validates the concept of disambiguation by looking for words in the neighborhood of the space between "apple" and "fruit".
--->

<!---
This step validates if semantic meaning can be kept when storing a data object in the hyperspace by calculating the centroid of a group of words.
--->

<!---
This step validates if the centroid calculation can be done quickly without retraining the ML model.
--->

<!---
## Things Rather Than Strings
This section discusses the concept of representing data objects as "things" and the use of GraphQL to represent the data inside Weaviate.
--->

<!---
This search led to the RDF structure used by schema.org, which inspired the representation of Weaviate's data objects.
--->

<!---
By the end of 2018, Weaviate was entered into a startup accelerator program and the team decided to focus on the NLP part and vector storage.
--->

<!---
This section discusses how people use Weaviate today, including semantic search and semantic classification.
--->

<!---
Weaviate will remain open source and new features will be released frequently.
--->

<!---
This section provides a link to an interview with Bob van Luijt about Vector Search and the AI stack.
