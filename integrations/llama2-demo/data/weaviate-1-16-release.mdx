## New Filter Operators

With Weaviate 1.16, it is now possible to filter data based on null values or array lengths. This feature introduces changes at three different stages of working with data in Weaviate:

1. **Importing Null Value**: When you import data into Weaviate, either with missing properties or with properties set to null, Weaviate will import the objects and set the index (for the missing/null properties) values to null.
2. **Indexing Null Values**: This is an optional feature since not everyone needs it. To filter by the null state, you need to first configure your schema to handle this.
3. **Filtering for Specific Property State**: With the new `IsNull` filter, you can perform queries that are filtered by the null state.

## Distributed Backups

In Weaviate 1.16, multi-sharded classes stored in a Weaviate cluster can now be completely backed up! This is a significant improvement that allows you to distribute your data across the cluster while ensuring a robust and safe way to restore objects when required.

## Ref2Vec Centroid Module

The new `ref2vec-centroid` module uses the average, or centroid vector, of the cross-referenced vectors to represent the referencing object. This module has applications in recommendation, knowledge graph representation, and representing long or complex multimodal objects.

## Node Status API

The new node API endpoint allows you to check in on the health of your running clusters quickly. You can do this by sending a GET request to the node endpoint, which will return a status check on all your nodes.

## More Powerful OIDC Auth

Weaviate supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, which users experience as a convenient and secure single sign-on. With this release, Weaviate works with Microsoft Azure-based OIDC authentication in addition to other popular solutions such as Keycloak or dex.

## Patch Releases Ready Sooner

Starting with Weaviate 1.15, new patch releases are published as soon as new important fixes are available, giving you access to the latest and greatest as soon as possible.
