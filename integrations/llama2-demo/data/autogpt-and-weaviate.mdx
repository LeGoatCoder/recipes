# title: Giving Auto-GPT Long-Term Memory with Weaviate


"""
As generative language models such as GPT-4 continue to push the boundaries of what AI can do,
the excitement surrounding its potential is spreading quickly. Many applications and projects
are built on top of GPT-4 to extend its capabilities and features. Additionally, many tools were
created in order to interact with large language models, like LangChain as an example.

Auto-GPT is one of the fastest rising open-source python projects harnessing the power of GPT-4!

# ## What is Auto-GPT?
# Auto-GPT has gotten a lot of attention lately, with the amount of stars jumping from 20k to 80k in a matter of days.
# Auto-GPT chains together “thoughts” and completes various tasks or assignments **autonomously**.
# It takes GPT-4 one step further by enabling the model to run iteratively and complete various tasks in a siloed fashion.
# It can [write code and execute python scripts](https://twitter.com/SigGravitas/status/1642181498278408193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1642181498278408193%7Ctwgr%5Eaa2e51a2fc46f95cf982d6baa333a4ea14d1b264%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FSigGravitas%2Fstatus%2F1642181498278408193image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07),

#
# ChatGPT requires humans to prompt the large language model (LLM) by developing and refining the text prompt.
# Meaning you need to build out your request step-by-step in order for the LLM to “understand”.
# Auto-GPT on the other hand, is able to independently define objectives needed to complete the assigned task
# **without (or with reduced) human feedback and intervention**.
# This is because of its ability to chain together thoughts.
#
# Chain of thought is a method that is used to help language models improve their reasoning.
# It breaks down tasks into the intermediate steps that are needed in order to complete it.
# The program will then run continuously until it completes these tasks.
# For example, if it is working on a coding project, it will debug the code as it goes.
#
# Let’s dig a little deeper into how Auto-GPT works under the hood.
# At the time of writing, Auto-GPT uses GPT-4 (or optionally, GPT-3.5) for text generation and GPT-3.5 for file storage and summarization.
# At configuration, Auto-GPT is given a list of tools such as a code executor, google search API, or a calculator.
# Additionally, it is possible to give Auto-GPT access to long-term memory via a vector database, such as [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/).
# Auto-GPT also has access to `skills` which are manifested as pre-configured prompts such as summarization.
#
# Armed with these tools, Auto-GPT begins with a user query.
# For example, “Please write out a grocery list and create a recipe using each ingredient.”
# Auto-GPT takes this task and proposes an action plan to achieve the task such as:
#
# Task: Write out a grocery list based on past items
#
# Plan:
# 1. Use the long-term memory from the Weaviate database to curate the list from last week
# 2. Order the groceries
# 3. Use the internet to look up different recipes
#
# Action:
# 1. View previous grocery lists
# 2. Order the groceries online
# 3. Use the internet to gather recipes
#
# Since Auto-GPT is able to form these action plans autonomously,
# it is important that it confirms each action was completed.
# It shouldn’t jump to step 2, if step 1 isn’t finished.
# It will do this by reasoning with its actions.
# From there it will review the results and make a refined plan.
# The ability to reason and refine its actions is what makes Auto-GPT so clever.
#
# ## Examples of Auto-GPT
# People all over Twitter have shared multiple demos of what they’ve built with Auto-GPT.
# The possibilities are endless!
# In this section, we will cover a few popular examples.
#
# [Sully](https://twitter.com/SullyOmarr/status/1645205292756418562) shared a thread on using Auto-GPT to conduct market research.
# The task is to understand the space of waterproof shoes and find 5 competitors.
# It will then need to report the pros and cons of each.
