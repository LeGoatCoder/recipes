title: Wikipedia and Weaviate

To conduct semantic search queries on a large scale, one needs a vector database to search through the large number of vector representations that represent the data. To show you how this can be done, [we have open-sourced the complete English language Wikipedia corpus](https://github.com/weaviate/semantic-search-through-wikipedia-with-weaviate) backup in Weaviate. In this article, I will outline how we've created the dataset, show you how you can run the dataset yourself, and present search strategies on how to implement similar vector and semantic search solutions in your own projects and how to bring them to production.

The Wikipedia dataset used is the "truthy" version of October 9th, 2021. After processing it contains 11.348.257 articles, 27.377.159 paragraphs, and 125.447.595 graph cross-references. Although a bigger machine (see below) is needed for importing the data, the serving is done on a 12 CPU, 100 GB RAM, 250Gb SSD Google Cloud VM with 1 x NVIDIA Tesla P4. The ML-models used are [multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1) and [bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad) both are available as [pre-built modules](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-transformers#pre-built-images) in Weaviate.

ðŸ“„ The complete dataset and code is open-source and available [on GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/semantic-search-through-wikipedia-with-weaviate).

## Importing the Data In Two Steps
> You can also directly import a backup into Weaviate without doing the import your self as outlined [here](https://github.com/weaviate/semantic-search-through-wikipedia-with-weaviate/tree/main#step-3-load-from-backup).

To import the data we use two different methods. The first is to clean the data set and the second one is to import the data.

### Step 1 â€“ Cleaning the Data
The first step is pretty straightforward, we will clean the data and create a [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) file to iterate over during import. You can run this process yourself or download the proceed file following [this](https://github.com/weaviate/semantic-search-through-wikipedia-with-weaviate#step-1-process-the-wikipedia-dump) link.
