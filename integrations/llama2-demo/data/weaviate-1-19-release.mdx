title: Weaviate 1.19 Release

We are happy to announce the release of Weaviate `1.19`, which brings a set of great features, performance improvements, and fixes.

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

1. [Group by arbitrary property](#group-by-arbitrary-property) – The groupBy option has been introduced to Get object retrieval, so you can group search results by any property.
1. [New (or improved) Data Types](#new-or-improved-data-types) – Datatypes changes with text having faster filtering & more tokenization options while deprecating string to reduce complexity, and adding uuid to allow efficient uuid storage.
1. [Generative Cohere Module](#generative-cohere-module) – Combines the best of Weaviate, retrieving and searching relevant documents with the generative capabilities of the models that Cohere is cooking up!
1. [Tunable Consistency for Vector Search and GraphQL Get Requests](#tunable-consistency-for-vector-search-and-graphql-get-requests) – Consistency tuning with replication is now available for vector search with Get requests.
1. [gRPC API support(experimental)](#grpc-api-support-experimental) – gRPC API support slowly being trialled, with some big potential for speedups.
1. [Other Improvements and Bug Fixes](#other-improvements-and-bug-fixes) – fixes and improvements delivered since `1.18`.

<h2 id="upgrade-with-caution">Upgrade with Caution</h2>

Keep in mind that after upgrading to `v1.19` a downgrade to `v1.18` will **no longer be supported**. If you anticipate having to downgrade, please create a backup before upgrading! If a backup is done with `v1.18` before upgrading, you can always go back to `v1.18` if you wish.

* With the `string`->`text` migration, downgrading after upgrading will not work.
* With the prop tracker fixes (bm25), once migrated you can’t downgrade again.

<h2 id="group-by-arbitrary-property">Group by arbitrary property</h2>

With the introduction of this feature, you can now group `Get` search results based on a specific property.

Take a collection of `Passage` objects for example, each object belonging to a `Document`. If searching through `Passage` objects, you can group the results according to any property of the `Passage`, including the cross-reference property that represents the `Document` each `Passage` is associated with.

The `groups` and `objectsPerGroup` limits are customizable. So in this example, you could retrieve the top 1000 objects and group them to identify the 3 most relevant `Document` objects, based on the top 3 `Passage` objects from each `Document`.

This functionality offers the advantage of maintaining granular search results by searching through detailed or segmented objects (e.g., `Passage`), while also enabling you to step back and view the broader context of the objects (e.g., `Document`).
