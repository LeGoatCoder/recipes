# Title: What if you could understand your unstructured data?

## Intro
"""
These days, more and more organizations are adopting a data-driven culture. Business
processes and customer experience benefit from good data collection, management and
analysis. But in order to really benefit from available data, it is essential to also
understand the unstructured data, like free text in PDF documents, emails, invoices or
voice transcriptions. Unstructured data is especially hard to index, manage and
understand. Since around 80% of all data is unstructured, it is hard to actually search
and retrieve insights from most of the data.
"""

## How does Weaviate work?
"""
Data usually refers to something in the real world. Traditional databases and search
engines often struggle with understanding the context of data, a situation or a search
query. The context of data is important, because it enables storage and search by
fuzzy concepts instead of exact matching keywords. Weaviate automatically places
concepts and words in relation to its context by using machine learning. It understands
that the Eiffel Tower is a landmark in Paris, and will place these concepts closely
together in the database model.
"""

## Example use cases
### Automatic classification
"""
Data classification is often done manually or by expensive external data science teams.
ERP (enterprise resource planning) and supply chain management systems rely on
correct classification of for example employees' travel expenses or ingredient
labeling of product packages. Automatic classification by Weaviate reduces manual
classification errors and eliminates expensive, single-to-use classification
applications. Automatic classification can also be applied to cybersecurity and event
management, where intervention on threats and riskful events should be taken
real-time. Current platforms deal with very large amounts of streaming data,
consisting of mostly free text. Weaviate can automatically recognize threats in free
text, and classify if and which mitigation should be taken. With Weaviate this can be
achieved near real-time, even on a very large scale.
"""

### Semantic search
"""
Traditional search systems return items that have an exact match with the search
terms. This means that searching through your emails for ‘reimbursement' will skip all
results about ‘compensation'. Searching for ‘science fiction' in a traditional book
search engine, might lead to anything related to ‘science' or ‘fiction' so this would
include ‘neuroscience' but not ‘a book about the future'. Weaviate uses semantic
search, and matches search results to the user's intent through contextual meaning.
For e-commerce websites this means that people searching for ‘jumpers' will also see
‘sweatshirts' simply because their contextual meaning is the same although the
keywords do not match.

See how automatically placing orange tompouces in the context of King's day might
thus actually lead to upselling your products and happier customers? Now there's
certainly also potential hidden in the majority of your data. Think about how an
AI-driven vector-search can unlock this from your organization's data!
