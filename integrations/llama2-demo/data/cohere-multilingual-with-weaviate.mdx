# title: Cohere Multilingual ML Models with Weaviate

## Intro
# Natural Language Processing (NLP) has enabled computers to understand the human language.
# It has shifted the way humans build and interact with computers.
# Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin the latest developments in NLP and have gained traction in various applications.
# Cohere is an AI platform that provides its users with access to its LLMs.
# Cohere gives developers and businesses the ability to implement NLP as part of their toolkit.

## Cohere + Weaviate
# Now, you can combine Cohere‚Äôs LLMs with a vector database like Weaviate to get the best of both worlds.
# More specifically, you can run complex NLP queries at a large scale of millions (and even billions) of text objects
# and get results back in a blink of an eye.

## Text2vec-cohere
# Over the last few weeks, we‚Äôve partnered with Cohere to create a new Weaviate module ‚Äì text2vec-cohere ‚Äì
# it allows you to use Cohere‚Äôs LLMs to run complex NLP queries straight from Weaviate.

## Text-understanding multilingual model
# Today, Cohere announced the release of the text-understanding multilingual model that supports 100+ languages.
# The multilingual model is perfect for search, content aggregation and recommendation, and zero-shot cross-lingual text classification.

## Multilingual model quick test
# After learning from our friends at Cohere that the model can handle over a hundred human languages,
# I was eager to test it out and see what I could achieve by running a few queries in different languages.

# Set up a new Weaviate instance in WCS
# Request a Cohere API key
# Configure data schema to use the Cohere embed-multilingual-v2.0 model
# Import a small (handcrafted) dataset

### Query for musical instruments
# Once my setup was ready, I was able to run queries like "What musical instruments do we have?" in Polish

# Run query in Polish
# "jakie mamy instrumenty muzyczne?"

# Run query in Hungarian
# "zenei hangszerek?"

# Both queries returned the following objects.
# Note the guitar content is in Italian, while the Drum content is in English.

### Query for small animals
# Next, I tried to query for "small animals" in Japanese.

# Run query in Japanese
# "Â∞èÂãïÁâ©"

# Which returned three objects about meerkats (each in a different language)
# and one about squirrels.

### Test conclusion
# Even though this was just a small test, the results I received back are great.
# I never thought it would be this easy to search across documents that are written in different languages.

# Over the Christmas break, I will take some time to build a larger app to more thoroughly test the Weaviate + Cohere combo.
# Something that will come with more data and test for more complex queries and scenarios. üòâ

# If you have interesting data project ideas, give me a shout on Weaviate community Slack or via Twitter @sebawita.

### Project in GitHub
# You can find the test project on GitHub. Follow the readme instructions on how to set it up for yourself.

# Probably the most interesting part is the query code, which is made of 3 parts:
# * nearText ‚Äì parameters where we pass in the query from the user
# * properties ‚Äì a list of properties we want back from the database
# * client.query ‚Äì it takes the above two, and runs a semantic search.
# Note, how it doesn‚Äôt even mention the Cohere model, as all of that is done through configuration.

## How does this work
# It is also important to understand how Weaviate and Cohere communicate with each other.

## Data import + modifications
# When you import (or update) data into Weaviate, Weaviate will:
# 1. Receive the data object
# 2. Send the relevant properties for vectorization to Cohere
# 3. Store the data object and index the vector in Weaviate

## Query
# When you query Weaviate, Weaviate will:
# 1. Receive the query
# 2. Send the query to Cohere to vectorize it
# 3. Use the returned query vector and search in the vector index
# 4. Return matched objects

## Full CRUD support
# It is worth knowing that Weaviate allows you to continuously modify the data whilst the database remains operational at all times.
# Exactly what you would expect from any database.
