# Title: Hybrid Search Explained

# Hybrid search is a technique that combines multiple search algorithms to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results.
# It uses the best features of both keyword-based search algorithms with vector search techniques.
# By leveraging the strengths of different algorithms, it provides a more effective search experience for users.

# The Hybrid search feature was introduced in Weaviate 1.17.
# It uses sparse and dense vectors to represent the meaning and context of search queries and documents.

# In this blog post, you will learn about the implementation of hybrid search in Weaviate and how to use it.

# Sparse and Dense Vectors
# Sparse and dense vectors are calculated with distinct algorithms.
# Sparse vectors have mostly zero values with only a few non-zero values,
# while dense vectors mostly contain non-zero values.
# Sparse embeddings are generated from algorithms like BM25 and SPLADE.
# Dense embeddings are generated from machine learning models like GloVe and Transformers.

# Note, the current implementation of hybrid search in Weaviate uses BM25/BM25F and vector search.
