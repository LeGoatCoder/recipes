How Weaviate's GraphQL API was designed

This code explains how the use of GraphQL leverages the UX of Weaviate,
and how we approach the design of this API.

# Weaviate is an open-source Vector Database for understandable
# knowledge representation, enabling semantic search and automatic
# classification.
title: How Weaviate's GraphQL API was designed

# Data needs to be added, retrieved and manipulated, all controlled
# by the user but enabled by the underlying database interface.
# Here's where APIs jump in.
Weaviate: An open-source Vector Database

# GraphQL is an API query language, which was open-sourced by
# Facebook in 2012 and currently maintained by the Linux Foundation.
# The core strength of GraphQL is that the client is fully in control
# of what data is returned.
GraphQL: An API query language

# The fields of interest are specified by the client, chosen from
# a schema defined by the server. This requires a well formulated
# schema.
Human-Centered API Design

# "Get" is a high level schema item that we defined. "Get" is a verb
# that we use when we want to retrieve something.
Get: A high level schema item

# The user might also store properties like "barcode" and "expirationDate",
# but chose not to retrieve those in this request.
Querying specific properties

# The goal of this query is to Get all the Products where the Stock is
# less than 100.
Querying with conditions

# We can then make the following query, where we want to Get all the
# Products where the Stock is less than 100, which are related to the
# text concept "fruits".
Querying with related concepts

# In the end, developers and UX designers need to collaborate in this
# requirement engineering process.
Iterative Prototyping and Feedback

# With Weaviate, we want to allow the end-user to be focused on their
# data, and thus not spend too much effort on thinking about how to
# actually access and interact with it.
