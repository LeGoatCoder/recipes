# Weaviate 1.17 Release

"""
We are happy to announce the release of Weaviate `1.17`, which brings a set of great features, performance improvements, and fixes.
"""

# The Brief
"""
If you like your content brief and to the point, here is the TL;DR of this release:

1. Replication
2. Hybrid Search
3. BM25
4. Faster Startup and Imports
5. Other Improvements and Bug Fixes
"""

# Replication
"""
Weaviate's `v1.17` release introduces **replication**. Replication enables you to set up your Weaviate environment in a cluster with multiple server nodes. Weaviate will automatically replicate data across nodes in the background.
"""

# Use Cases
"""
This enables a variety of use cases, such as:
- Higher availability of data
- Improved throughput of read requests
- Zero downtime upgrades
- Regional proximity
"""

# Replication Design in Weaviate
"""
Replication in Weaviate is modeled after how users typically use Weaviate. Most use cases are very-large-scale, which aim for low latency and high availability.

It is often tolerable if data is temporarily out of sync, as long as consistency is reached eventually. Keeping the CAP Theorem trade-offs in mind, Weaviate's replication architecture prefers availability over consistency.

Nevertheless, both read and write consistency will become fully tunable from `v1.18`.

Weaviate has a leaderless replication design, so there is no distinction between primary and secondary nodes, thereby removing all single points of failures.
"""

# Roadmap
"""
With `v1.17`, the foundations of replication are built into Weaviate. In `v1.18` and later releases, more features will be added:

| Weaviate version | Expected release | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `v1.17` | Live | * Leaderless Replication<br />* Tunable Read Consistency for Get-by-ID requests |
| `v1.18` | Feb 2023 | * Tunable Write Consistency<br />* Tunable Read Consistency for all requests<br />* Repairs â€“ Read-Repairs or Background/Async Repairs |
| TBD | TBD | * Multi-Datacenter replication (upvote it [here](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/issues/2436)) |

"""

# Hybrid Search
"""
Hybrid search is a search functionality that combines the best features of both keyword-based search algorithms with vector search techniques. In hybrid search, sparse and dense vectors are used to represent the meaning and context of search queries and documents.
"""

# Hybrid Search Query
"""
Here is an example of how to run a hybrid search query in GraphQL:



"""

# What's next in Hybrid
"""
Work on hybrid search is not over! We will continue to make improvements and introduce new features in the future. For example, there is already something in the backlog to add `where` filters to hybrid search (give it a thumbs up while you're there). ðŸ™‚
"""

# Learn More
"""
The hybrid operator is available through GraphQL, REST and all Weaviate client languages. Check out the [documentation](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/vector-search-parameters#hybrid) for more information and learn how to write the query in the other client programming languages.
"""

# BM25
"""
BM25 ("Best Match #25" - it took quite a few iterations to arrive at the current state of the art ðŸ˜‰) is a family of ranking functions that is widely used in information retrieval to score and rank documents based on their relevance to a given search query.
"""

# BM25 Operator
"""
In Weaviate v1.17, we introduce a search operator called `bm25`, which performs a case-insensitive keyword search, then ranks the results using the BM25F ranking function - **B**est **M**atch **25** with Extension to Multiple Weighted **F**ields, a variant of BM25 that can take into account different weights for different properties (fields) of the document, in order to produce more accurate results.
"""

# Core Concept
"""
The basic idea behind BM25 is to score a document based on the number of times a particular term appears in the document, as well as the overall length of the document - one occurrence in a tweet is much more significant than one occurrence in a book. Essentially, this is done using a combination of term frequency (TF - the more times the term appears, the higher the score) and inverse document frequency (IDF - if a term occurs rarely in the documents in the corpus, then whenever it does occur, that occurrence is probably significant).
"""

# When to use BM25
"""
BM25 is best used when an exact match for the query keywords is desired (and the order of the words in the query is not important) and in out-of-domain searches (when the model is not specifically trained on the corpus of documents). If stemming or semantic similarity are desired, Weaviate's [vector search](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/vector-search-parameters#hybrid) will be better suited.
"""

# BM25 Query Example
"""
The `bm25` operator takes one required parameter, a string `query`, and an optional `properties` parameter - an array of property names, each of which being optionally weighted by a factor placed after a `^` character.

Here is a GraphQL example using the `bm25` argument:
