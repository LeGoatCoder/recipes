Title: The History of Weaviate
This article shares the history of Weaviate, including its origins, concept, and future plans.

<!---
## A World of Wonders called Natural Language Processing
This section introduces the concept of word embeddings and how they represent words in a multidimensional hyperspace.
--->

<!---
### Example of an embedding
This subsection provides an example of a word embedding for the word "squarepants".
--->

<!---
This metaphor explains how word embeddings work by comparing them to a supermarket, where similar products are located near each other.
--->

<!---
Being able to represent words in a space allows for calculating with language, making it possible to look up what is in the neighborhood in the space instead of creating algorithms to understand language.
--->

## How to semantically store data objects
This section discusses the challenges of naming and searching in software projects and how semantic storage can help solve these issues.
--->

<!---
The validation of the concept was broken down into three main sections: finding context around a word, keeping semantic meaning, and doing it quickly without retraining the ML model.
--->

<!---
Finding context around a word is achieved through disambiguation, which involves looking for words in the neighborhood of the hyperspace.
--->

<!---
This image shows how disambiguation works by looking for words in the neighborhood of the space between "apple" and "fruit".
--->

<!---
Calculating the centroid of a group of words allows for keeping semantic meaning when storing data objects in the hyperspace.
--->

<!---
This example shows how the centroid calculation works for the title of a Vogue article.
--->

<!---
By validating these assumptions, it is possible to store data objects in a semantic space instead of a traditional row-column structure or graph.
--->

<!---
## Things Rather Than Strings
This section discusses the concept of "things" and how they can be represented in a graph format.
--->

<!---
The RDF structure used by schema.org inspired the representation of Weaviate's data objects.
--->

<!---
The combination of realtime vectorization of data objects and RDF-like representation of Weaviate objects in GraphQL allows for the creation of the Weaviate Search Graph.
--->

<!---
The Birth of the Weaviate Search Graph
This section discusses the creation of the Weaviate Search Graph and the decision to focus on the NLP part and vector storage.
--->

<!---
This image shows the Weaviate Console, which is a user interface for Weaviate.
--->

<!---
The Future
This section discusses the future plans for Weaviate, including new features and services.
--->

<!---
This link leads to a podcast episode where Bob van Luijt talks about Vector Search and the AI stack.
