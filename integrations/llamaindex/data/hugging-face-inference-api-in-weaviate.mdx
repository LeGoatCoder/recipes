# Title: Support for Hugging Face Inference API in Weaviate

# Vector databases use Machine Learning models to offer incredible functionality to operate on your data.
# We are looking at anything from summarizers, through auto-labelers, to transformers and vectorizers
# and many more use cases.
# 
# All of these use cases require Machine Learning model inference, which is a compute-heavy process.
# 
# Running model inference in production is hard.
# It requires expensive specialized hardware, a lot more computing power during the initial data import,
# hardware tends to be underutilized once the bulk of the heavy work is done, and sharing and prioritizing
# resources with other teams is hard.
# 
# The good news is, there are companies â€“ like Hugging Face, OpenAI, and Cohere â€“ that offer running model
# inference as a service.
# 
# Starting from Weaviate v1.15, Weaviate includes a Hugging Face module, which provides support for Hugging Face
# Inference straight from the vector database.
# 
# The Hugging Face module, allows you to use the Hugging Face Inference service with sentence similarity models,
# to vectorize and query your data, straight from Weaviate. No need to run the Inference API yourself.
# 
# You can choose between text2vec-huggingface (Hugging Face) and text2vec-openai (OpenAI) modules to delegate
# your model inference tasks.
# Both modules are enabled by default in the Weaviate Cloud Services.
# 
# Overview
# 
# The Hugging Face module is quite incredible, for many reasons.
# 
# Public models
# You get access to over 1600 pre-trained sentence similarity models. No need to train your own models, if
# there is already one that works well for your use case.
# 
# Private models
# If you have your own models, trained specially for your data, then you can upload them to Hugging Face
# (as private modules), and use them in Weaviate.
# 
# Fully automated and optimized
# Weaviate manages the whole process for you. From the perspective of writing your code â€“ once you have
# your schema configuration â€“ you can almost forget that Hugging Face is involved at all.
# 
# Ready to use with a minimum of fuss
# Every new Weaviate instance created with the Weaviate Cloud Services has the Hugging Face module enabled out of the box.
# 
# To use the Hugging Face module in Weaviate open source (v1.15 or newer), you only need to set text2vec-huggingface
# as the default vectorizer.
# 
# How to get started
# 
# The overall process to use a Hugging Face module with Weaviate is fairly straightforward.
# 
# You would need the following ingredients:
# 1. Raw Data
# 2. Hugging Face API token â€“ which you can request from their website
# 3. A working Weaviate instance with the text2vec-huggingface enabled
# 
# Then you would follow these steps.
# 
# Step 1 â€“ initial preparation â€“ create schema and select the hf models
# Once you have a Weaviate instance up and running.
# Define your schema (standard stuff â€“ pick a class name, select properties, and data types).
# As a part of the schema definition, you also need to provide, which Hugging Face model you want to use for each schema class.
# 
# Step 2 â€“ cook for some time â€“ import data
# Start importing data into Weaviate.
# For this, you need your Hugging Face API token, which is used to authorize all calls with ðŸ¤—.
# 
# Step 3 â€“ serving portions â€“ querying data
# Once, you imported some or all of the data, you can start running queries.
# Running queries also requires the same token.
# But you can reuse the same client, so you are good to go.
# 
# Then, you just run the queries, as per usual.

# Summary
# Now you can use Hugging Face or OpenAI modules in Weaviate to delegate model inference out.
# Just pick the model, provide your API key and start working with your data.
# Weaviate optimizes the communication process with the Inference API for you, so that you can focus on the challenges
# and requirements of your applications. No need to run the Inference API yourself.
