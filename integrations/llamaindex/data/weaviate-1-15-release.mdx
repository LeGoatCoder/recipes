// Title: Weaviate 1.15 release

// We are happy to announce the release of Weaviate 1.15, which is packed with great features, significant performance improvements, new distance metrics and modules, and many smaller improvements and fixes.

// The brief
// If you like your content brief and to the point, here is the TL;DR of this release:

// 1. [‚òÅÔ∏èCloud-native backups](#cloud-native-backups) - allows you to configure your environment to create backups - of selected classes or the whole database - straight into AWS S3, GCS or local filesystem
// 2. [Reduced memory usage](#reduced-memory-usage) - we found new ways to optimize memory usage, reducing RAM usage by 10-30%.
// 3. [Better control over Garbage Collector](#better-control-over-garbage-collector) - with the introduction of GOMEMLIMIT we gained more control over the garbage collector, which significantly reduced the chances of OOM kills for your Weaviate setups.
// 4. [Faster imports for ordered data](#faster-imports-for-ordered-data) - by extending the Binary Search Tree structure with a self-balancing Red-black tree, we were able to speed up imports from O(n) to O(log n)
// 5. [More efficient filtered aggregations](#more-efficient-filtered-aggregations) - thanks to optimization to a library reading binary data, filtered aggregations are now 10-20 faster and require a lot less memory.
// 6. [Two new distance metrics](#new-distance-metrics) - with the addition of Hamming and Manhattan distance metrics, you can choose the metric (or a combination of) to best suit your data and use case.
// 7. [Two new Weaviate modules](#new-weaviate-modules) - with the Summarization module, you can summarize any text on the fly, while with the HuggingFace module, you can use compatible transformers from the HuggingFace
// 8. [Other improvements and bug fixes](#other-improvements-and-bug-fixes) - it goes without saying that with every Weaviate release, we strive to make Weaviate more stable - through bug fixes - and more efficient - through many optimizations.

// Read below to learn more about each of these points in more detail.

// Community effort
// ![New Contributors](./img/new-contributors.jpg)

// üòÄWe are extremely happy about this release, as it includes two big community contributions from [Aakash Thatte](https://github.com/sky-2002) and [Dasith Edirisinghe](https://github.com/DasithEdirisinghe). Over the last few weeks, they collaborated with our engineers to make their contributions.

// üöÄ**Aakash** implemented the two **new distance metrics**, while **Dasith** contributed by implementing the two **new Weaviate modules**.

//   üëïI guess we will should send some Weaviate t-shirts to Aakash and Dasith soon.

// ü§óWe hope to see many more big and small contributions in the coming months and years. **#CommunityRocks**

// ## Cloud-native backups

// ![Cloud-native backups](./img/cloud-native-backup.png)

// Creating and restoring database backups in Weaviate was one of the most requested features from the Weaviate community and customers.

// And, of course, database backups are not just about disaster recovery. Sometimes we need to migrate our data to a different environment. Maybe because our database grew and now we need more resources, or perhaps we need to set up a new developer environment.

// We listened to your feedback, suggestions and use cases! So we made it our mission for the `1.15` release to design and implement an **elegant solution** with a great **Developer Experience (DX)**, which you will love üòç to use for years to come.

// ### Announcement
// Introducing **Weaviate Cloud-native backups**. üéâ

// It allows you to make full database backups (or selected classes) straight to **S3**, **GCS** or the **local filesystem** with a single API call ü§©; and restore the data to a Weaviate instance of your choice with another API call.

// What is really great about this implementation is that you can create a backup without downtime on a running instance. The database stays fully operational (including receiving writes) while the backup is transferred to the remote storage.

// The database backups include data objects, plus their vectors and indexes. This way, restoring a backup is a straight copy of all the required elements without the need to re-create vectors or rebuild the indexes. (Read, this is going to be fast)

// ### Backup modules
// Cloud-native backups in Weaviate are handled with the addition of the new **backup modules**:

// * `backup-s3` - for S3
// * `backup-gcs` - for GCS
// * `backup-fs` - for local filesystem

// Without getting into too many details (see the [docs for more precise instructions](/developers/weaviate/configuration/backups)), each module requires a different set of settings.

// For S3 and GCS, you need your cloud bucket name, authentication details and some extra details like a project name or the cloud region.

// > For S3 authentication you can use access keys or IAM with role ARN's.
// >
// > For GCS you can use a Google Application Credentials json file.

// Alternatively, you can configure backups with the **local filesystem**. All you need here is to provide the path to the backup folder.

// > Note, you can have multiple storage configurations - one for each S3, GCS and the local filesystem.

// ### Creating backups - API
// Once you have the backup module up and running, you can create backups with a single `POST` command
