Weaviate: A vector database with ANN Index and CRUD support

This code provides an overview of Weaviate, a cloud-native, modular, real-time vector database
built to scale machine learning models. Weaviate supports both custom vector positions and
optional modules for text, images, and other media types. It offers full CRUD capabilities,
real-time querying, and persistence, unlike many popular ANN libraries.

# Introduction

# The rising popularity of machine learning models has increased the demand for vector
# similarity search solutions. Weaviate is a vector database that enables fast and large-scale
# vector searches with ANN Index and CRUD support.

# ANN models enable fast vector searches, but many popular libraries fall short of providing
# essential features found in traditional databases and search engines. Weaviate removes these
# limitations, offering a vector database that scales machine learning models.

# Overview

# This article covers:
# 1. How ANN models enable fast and large-scale vector searches
# 2. Limitations of popular ANN libraries
# 3. Introduction to Weaviate and its features
# 4. A glimpse into how Weaviate works under the hood

# What is Weaviate?

# Weaviate is a cloud-native, modular, real-time vector database that scales machine learning
# models. It is open-source and supports both custom vector positions and optional modules
# for text, images, and other media types. Weaviate offers full CRUD capabilities and real-time
# querying, making it an ideal solution for various use cases.

# When do you call a database a database?

# This section outlines the essential principles of a database, including CRUD, real-time
# querying, mutability, persistence, consistency, resiliency, and scaling.

# Popular ANN libraries fall short of many of the above principles

# Popular ANN libraries, such as Annoy and ScaNN, lack real-time capabilities and mutability.
# They require importing all data objects upfront, followed by a build period to create the index.
# Once the index is built, updating or deleting objects is impossible without rebuilding the index.

# Weaviate overcomes the limitations of ANN libraries

# Weaviate combines the speed and large-scale capabilities of ANN models with full database
# functionality. It supports real-time querying, full CRUD capabilities, and mutability of its
# indices, ensuring that every write is persisted.

# How can Weaviate achieve all of this?

# Weaviate's custom HNSW implementation supports querying while inserting, full CRUD support,
# and efficient cleanup processes for deleted objects. This makes Weaviate the perfect solution
# for handling vector search needs in production.

# Choose what's right for your use case

# This section helps you decide whether to use a library like Annoy or ScaNN or Weaviate based
# on your specific requirements.
