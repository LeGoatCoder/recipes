# Monitoring Weaviate in Production

# Weaviate is designed to be easy to monitor and detect issues by following a cloud native approach. It supports:
# 1. Publishing of Prometheus metrics to the standard `/metrics` endpoint
# 2. Use of built-in Kubernetes liveness and readiness checks
# 3. Configuration of settings via environment variables
# 4. Simplified deployment via helm charts

# There is existing documentation on the exported metrics which also has an example for how to use a Prometheus instance for metrics.

# A common question is: How can I integrate Weaviate with my existing observability stack?
# This article describes two approaches using either Grafana agent or Datadog agent to scrape these metrics.

# Prerequisites
# It is assumed that you have already deployed Weaviate. By default Prometheus monitoring is disabled, so you can enable it with this environment setting:
PROMETHEUS_MONITORING_ENABLED=true

# Weaviate will then publish Prometheus metrics on port `2
