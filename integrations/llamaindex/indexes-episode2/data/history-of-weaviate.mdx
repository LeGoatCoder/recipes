In this article, I want to share the history of Weaviate, how the concept was born, and where we are heading towards in the near future.

## A World of Wonders called Natural Language Processing
Somewhere early 2015 I was introduced to the concept of word embeddings through the publication of an article that contained a machine-learning algorithm to turn individual words into embeddings called [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

### Example of an embedding




If you are new to the world of word embeddings, a metaphor to understand them is in the form of a supermarket. The supermarket itself is a space in which products are stored based on the category they are in. Inside, you can find an apple by moving your shopping cart to the right coordinates in the fruit section and when you look around you, you'll find similar products like oranges, limes, bananas, etcetera, and you also know that a cucumber will be closer by than washing powder.

This is the same way a word embedding is structured. All the coordinates combined represent a multidimensional hyperspace (often around 300 dimensions) and words that have a similar meaning are more closely related to each other, like similar products in the store.

Being able to represent words in a space gives you a superpower, because it allows you to calculate with language! Instead of creating algorithms to understand language, it is now possible to simply look up what is in the neighborhood in the space.

## How to semantically store data objects
While working on software projects in my day-to-day life, I noticed that one of the most recurring challenges presented itself in naming and searching. How would we call certain objects and how could we find data that was structured in different ways? I fell in love with the semantic web but the challenge I saw there, was the need to have people agree on naming conventions and standards.

This made me wonder, what if we wouldn't have to agree on this any more? What if we could just store data and have the machine figure out the concept that your data represents?

The validation of the concept was chunked up into three main sections that were validated one by one.

1. Can one get more context around a word by moving through the hyperspace? If so;
1. Can one keep semantic meaning by calculating a centroid of a group of words (e.g., "thanks for the sushi last week")? If so;
1. Can this be done fast without retraining the ML model?

Finding more context around a word has to do with a concept called disambiguation. Take for example the word "apple". In the hyperspace, if you look for other words in the neighborhood, you will find words related to apple the fruit (e.g., other fruits, juices, etcetera) but also Apple the company (iPhone, Macintosh, and other concepts related to the company).

To validate if we could disambiguate the word "apple" the following simple step was taken. What if we looked for all the words that are in the neighborhood of the space in between "apple" and "fruit"? Turns out the results are way better! We can disambiguate by moving through the hyperspace while using individual words as beacons to navigate.

In the next step, the goal was to validate if we could keep semantic meaning when storing a data object in the hyperspace by calculating the centroid using the individual words as beacons. We did that as follows, the title of this Vogue article: "Louis Vuitton's New Capsule with League of Legends Brings French High Fashion to Online Gaming â€” and Vice Versa".

If we look up the vector positions for the individual words (Louis, Vuittosh, new, capsule, etc.) and place a new beacon in the center of the space of those vector positions, can we find the article by searching for "haute couture"? This turns out to work as well! Of course, through time, the centroid calculation algorithm in Weaviate has become way more sophisticated, but the overall concept is still the same.

> By validating the above two assumptions, we knew that we could almost instantly store data objects in a semantic space rather than a more traditional row-column structure or graph. This allows us to index data based on its meaning.

Although we had validated the assumptions of the semantic concepts, it was not enough to create an actual semantic search engine. Weaviate also needed a data model to represent these results.
