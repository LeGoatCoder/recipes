Running Large Language Models Privately - privateGPT and Beyond

This script discusses the privacy challenge in using Large Language Models (LLMs)
and potential solutions to ensure robust data privacy while harnessing the power
of these LLMs.
"""

# Understanding the Privacy Challenge
######################################

# LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, leading to privacy concerns.
# The traditional approach of relying on cloud-based services for inference
# requires organizations to transfer their data to third-party centralized model
# providers, leading to data exposure, data breaches, and unauthorized access.

# To leverage the advantages of generative AI while addressing these privacy
# concerns, the field of privacy-preserving machine learning has emerged.


# Potential Solutions to the Privacy Challenge
##############################################

# Federated Learning
# ------------------

# Federated Learning enables model training without directly accessing or
# transferring user data. Instead, individual edge devices or servers
# collaboratively train the model while keeping the data local.

    pass


# Homomorphic Encryption
# ----------------------

# Homomorphic encryption (HE) allows computations to be performed on encrypted
# data without decrypting it. It is a powerful tool for preserving privacy in
# scenarios where sensitive data needs to be processed or analyzed while
# maintaining confidentiality.

def homomorphic_encryption():

# Locally Deployed LLMs
# ---------------------

# Running open-source LLMs locally is a practical solution for organizations
# to securely leverage the power of OSS LLMs on their own proprietary documents.

def locally_deployed_llms():
    """
    Explains the concept of locally deployed LLMs and how companies can use them
    with custom data.
    """
    pass


# Running LLMs with Custom Data
# ------------------------------

# To get any LLM, local or remote, to answer prompts grounded in your custom
# data, store the documents in a vector database so that when needed the LLM
# can look up and retrieve the relevant documents and consume them to learn
# more context prior to generating a prompt.

    Explains the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and how it can
    be used to provide LLMs with custom data and context.

    pass


# Advantages and Disadvantages of a Local/Private Setup
# ----------------------------------------------------

# The advantages of locally deploying your vector database and LLM models
# include data privacy guarantees, reduced attack surface, and compliance with
# data protection and privacy regulations. The disadvantages include high
# upfront costs, ongoing maintenance expenses, and the need for extensive
# technical expertise.

# Conclusion
############

# As we move forward, it is crucial for the AI community to continue prioritizing
# privacy and security, ensuring that LLMs can be deployed in a manner that
# respects individual privacy rights.
