# This is a markdown file explaining the concept of vector search and how it is implemented in Weaviate, a vector database.

# The file starts by explaining the 'wow' factor of vector search, which is its ability to quickly search through a large dataset (in this case, 28 million Wikipedia paragraphs) and return relevant results in milliseconds.

# It then explains what a vector search is, and how it differs from a regular keyword search. A vector search looks for answers based on the semantic meaning of the query and data, rather than matching keywords exactly.

# The file then answers the question of why vector search is so fast, by explaining how vector databases work. Vector databases index data based on data vectors, or vector embeddings, which capture the meaning and context of the data. These vectors are calculated using machine learning models.

# The file goes on to explain how a vector search works, by comparing a query vector to the vectors of the data objects in the database and returning the ones that are most similar.

# It then discusses the limitations of a simple k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm for finding similar vectors, and how it can be computationally expensive.

# The file then introduces the concept of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms, which trade off a bit of accuracy for a huge gain in speed. ANN algorithms are able to maintain good performance on large-scale datasets, and are used in vector databases like Weaviate.

# The file concludes by summarizing the key points about vector search and Weaviate, and provides resources for learning more.
