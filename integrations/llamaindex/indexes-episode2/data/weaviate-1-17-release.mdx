# Replication
replication:
  title: Replication
  description: |
    Weaviate's `v1.17` release introduces **replication**. Replication enables you to set up your Weaviate environment in a cluster with multiple server nodes. Weaviate will automatically replicate data across nodes in the background.

  use_cases:
    - description: High availability
      text: If a Weaviate node goes down, another node can shoulder the load without losing availability or data. Data in Weaviate will thus have a **higher availability** for its users.

    - description: Improved throughput for read requests
      text: Replication can improve the **throughput of read requests**, as you can use all additional nodes to spread the load of queries. Adding extra database nodes can serve more users simultaneously.

    - description: Zero downtime upgrades
      text: Database replication enables **zero downtime upgrades**, because only a single node has to stop at a time while other replicas can continue serving.

    - description: Regional proximity
      text: With Multi-DataCenter replication, you can put Weaviate servers in different locations, which can decrease latency for users spread out geographically. The Multi-DataCenter feature is not implemented yet, [but we are already working on it](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/issues/2436).

  design:
    title: Replication Design in Weaviate
    description: |
      Replication in Weaviate is modeled after how users typically use Weaviate. Most use cases are very-large-scale, which aim for low latency and high availability.

      It is often tolerable if data is temporarily out of sync, as long as consistency is reached eventually. Keeping the [CAP Theorem](/developers/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/#cap-theorem) trade-offs in mind, Weaviate's replication architecture **prefers availability over consistency**.

      Nevertheless, both read and write consistency will become [fully tunable](/developers/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/consistency) from `v1.18` (read consistency is partly tunable from `v1.17`).

      Weaviate has a [leaderless replication design](/developers/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/cluster-architecture), so there is no distinction between primary and secondary nodes, thereby removing all single points of failures.

  roadmap:
    title: Roadmap
    description: |
      With `v1.17`, the foundations of replication are built into Weaviate. In `v1.18` and later releases, more features will be added:

    table:
      - version: v1.17
        release_date: Live
        features:
          - Leaderless Replication
          - Tunable Read Consistency for Get-by-ID requests

      - version: v1.18
        release_date: Feb 2023
        features:
          - Tunable Write Consistency
          - Tunable Read Consistency for all requests
          - Repairs – Read-Repairs or Background/Async Repairs

      - version: TBD
        release_date: TBD
        features:
          - Multi-Datacenter replication (upvote it [here](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/issues/2436))

# Hybrid Search
hybrid_search:
  title: Hybrid Search
  description: |
    Hybrid search is a search functionality that **combines** the best features of both keyword-based search algorithms with vector search techniques. In hybrid search, sparse and dense vectors are used to represent the meaning and context of search queries and documents. Sparse embeddings are generated from models like [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) and [SPLADE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05720). Dense embeddings are generated from machine learning models like [GloVe](https://text2vec.org/glove.html) and [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).

  use_case:
    description: Combining keyword matching and contextual semantics
    text: Using both sparse and dense search methods combines the power of keyword matching with contextual semantics. For example, in the query "How to catch an Alaskan Pollock?", the semantic meaning of "catch" is revealed to be related to fishing from the context; this is where dense vectors thrive. Sparse methods on their own would not be able to associate "catch" with fishing any differently from catching a baseball or a cold. On the other hand, sparse methods can capture specific entities such as "Alaskan Pollock". This query illustrates an example where hybrid search combines the best of both sparse and dense vectors.

  query:
    title: Hybrid Search Query
    description: |
      Here is an example of how to run a hybrid search query in GraphQL:

    graphql: |
      ```
      {
        Get {
          Corpus (
            hybrid: {
              query: "How to catch an Alaskan Pollock?",
