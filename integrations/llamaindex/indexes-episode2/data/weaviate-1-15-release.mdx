// Title: Weaviate 1.15 release

// We are happy to announce the release of Weaviate 1.15, which is packed with great features,
// significant performance improvements, new distance metrics and modules, and many smaller
// improvements and fixes.

// The brief
// If you like your content brief and to the point, here is the TL;DR of this release:

// 1. [☁️Cloud-native backups](#cloud-native-backups) - allows you to configure your environment
// to create backups - of selected classes or the whole database - straight into AWS S3, GCS or
// local filesystem
// 2. [Reduced memory usage](#reduced-memory-usage) - we found new ways to optimize memory
// usage, reducing RAM usage by 10-30%.
// 3. [Better control over Garbage Collector](#better-control-over-garbage-collector) - with
// the introduction of GOMEMLIMIT we gained more control over the garbage collector, which
// significantly reduced the chances of OOM kills for your Weaviate setups.
// 4. [Faster imports for ordered data](#faster-imports-for-ordered-data) - by extending the
// Binary Search Tree structure with a self-balancing Red-black tree, we were able to speed up
// imports from O(n) to O(log n)
//
