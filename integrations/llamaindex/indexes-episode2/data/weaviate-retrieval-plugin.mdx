# Title: The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin - Weaviate as a Long-term Memory Store for Generative AI

# Overview of ChatGPT plugins
# ChatGPT plugins are explained as the “eyes and ears” of LLMs to help products like ChatGPT interact more naturally with users by knowing of and integrating with other apps.
# However, plugins are much more than just the “eyes and ears” of ChatGPT. They allow ChatGPT to leverage third-party resources to act upon the conversations that you have with it.

# The ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin
# The ChatGPT retrieval plugin allows you to connect ChatGPT to an instance of a vector database like Weaviate.
# Anything stored in a connected vector database can then be used to answer questions to prompts, thus allowing ChatGPT to “know” your custom data and answer questions based on the details stored in the vector database!
# The vector database can also be used as a long-term storage of memory for ChatGPT to persist and store portions of your conversations from the short-lived memory of a tab to the long-term storage capabilities of a vector database.

# The ChatGPT retrieval plugin can be used to get ChatGPT to accomplish tasks grounded in the context of knowledge stored in a connected vector database such as Weaviate.
# This process consists of two steps: first, we prompt ChatGPT with a question that it uses to craft a query that can be sent to the vector database.
# The connected vector database then responds with relevant information and context by searching and filtering a subset of your data.
# The second step involves this information being passed to ChatGPT so that it can formulate its answer to accomplish the task specified in the prompt.

# The main functionality this plugin enables is:
# - It allows you to attach a vector database, to ChatGPT, that has proprietary data that can be used by ChatGPT when answering very specific questions
# - It allows you to persist personal documents and details to give ChatGPT a personal touch so that answers are not just general but can be catered to you
# - You can persist conversations with ChatGPT in the attached vector database to carry on conversations between turning on and shutting off ChatGPT tabs

# The Weaviate Retrieval Plugin in Action
# The Weaviate Retrieval Plugin allows you to leverage the capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT's GPT4.0 in real-life use cases by applying its generative power to new or custom data.
# For example, this would enable a private customized version of ChatGPT that's been trained on your company's internal documents and could act as a human resources chatbot.
# Another great application that the Weaviate Retrieval Plugin enables is customization of ChatGPT around your personal details.
# For the last example, the plugin can be used to persist the memory of previous conversations you have with ChatGPT into Weaviate, so that it can refer to them in a later conversation.
