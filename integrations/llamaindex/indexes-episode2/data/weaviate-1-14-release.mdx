<!-- title: Weaviate 1.14 release -->

<!-- ## What is new -->
We are excited to announce the release of Weaviate 1.14, the most reliable and observable Weaviate release yet.

> Later this week, we will release Weaviate v1.14, possibly the most boring release so far.ðŸ˜± Yet I'm incredibly excited about it and so should you. Why? <br/>

Besides many bug fixes and reliability improvements, we have a few neat features that you might find interesting. In short, this release covers:

* Reliability fixes and improvements
* Monitoring and Observability
* Support for non-cosine distances
* API changes

<!-- ## Reliability fixes and improvements -->
![Reliability and fixes](./img/reliability.png)

At Weaviate, Reliability is one of our core values, which means that we will always strive to make our software dependable, bug-free, and behave as expected.

And yes, bug fixing is not always the most exciting topic, as we often get more excited about shiny new features. But for you to truly enjoy working with Weaviate, we need to make sure that no bugs are getting in the way.

Check out [the changelog](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/releases/tag/v1.14.0) to see the complete list of features and over 25 bug fixes.

<!-- ### Critical bug fix in compaction logic -->
In this release we fixed a critical bug, which in rare situations could result in data loss.<br/>
The bug affected environments with frequent updates and deletes.

> This bug fix alone, makes it worth upgrading to Weaviate 1.14.

#### Background
We found a critical error in the compactioniong logic that could lead to the compaction operation either corrupting or completely losing data elements.

This could be obsereved through a variety of symptoms:
  * Retrieving an object by it's ID would lead to a different result than retrieving the object using a filter on the id property
  * Filters that should match a specific number of objects matched fewer objects than expected
  * Objects missing completely
  * Filters with `limit=1` would not return any results when there should be exactly one element, but increasing the limit would then include the object
  * Filters would return results with `null` ids

#### Example
In the first case, if you had an object with id: **my-id-123456**.

Calling the following GraphQL API with a filter on id would return the expected object.




However, calling the following REST API with the same id wouldn't get the object back.



#### The problem
So, if your data manipulation logic depended on the above operations to perform as expected, you update and delete operations might have been issued incorrectly.

<!-- ### Improved performance for large scale data imports -->
Weaviate `1.14` significantly improves the performance of data imports for large datasets.

Note that the performance improvements should be noticeable for imports of over 10 million objects. Furthermore, this update enables you to import over 200 million objects into the database.

#### Problem
Before, the HNSW index would grow in constant intervals of 25,000 objects. This was fine for datasets under 25 million objects. But once the database got to around 25 million objects, adding new objects would be significantly slower. Then from 50â€“100m, the import process would slow down to a walking pace.

#### Solution
To address this problem, we changed how the HNSW index grows. We implemented a relative growth pattern, where the HNSW index size increases by either 25% or 25'000 objects (whichever is bigger).

#### Test
After introducing the relative growth patterns, we've run a few tests.
We were able to import 200 million objects and more, while the import performance remained constant throughout the process.

<!-- ### Drastically improved Mean-Time-To-Recovery (MTTR) -->
Weaviate `1.14` fixes an issue where a crash-recovery could take multiple minutes, or even hours in some extreme cases. It is now a matter of just seconds. So even in the rare event that your instance crashes, it will come back up very quickly.

#### Problem
If Weaviate encounters an unexpected crash, no data will be lost. To provide this guarantee, a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is in place. If a crash had occurred, the WAL is parsed at startup, and all previously unfinished operations are recovered, even if they were part of in-memory structures that had not yet been flushed. While this system is very safe, the recovery could be slow for several reasons:

- Unflushed memtables could become very large. This would lead to a lot of data that needs to be recovered after a crash
- The recovery process was single-threaded. If multiple recoveries were required, they would happen in sequence. On a large machine, this could mean that startup would be slow, yet only one of many CPU cores was utilized.
- The data structure used to hold the recovered items was never intended to hold many items. Each additional insertion would degrade its performance. As a result, the larger the WAL to recover, the slower the recovery would become.

#### Solution
We addressed each of the points above individually and improved the overall MT
