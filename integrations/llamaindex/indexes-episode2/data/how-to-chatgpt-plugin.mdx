# title: How to Create Your Own ChatGPT Plugin

## Introduction

# A couple weeks back in our blog on [ChatGPT plugins](/blog/weaviate-retrieval-plugin) we talked about the potential for plugins to help expand ChatGPT‚Äôs functionality by allowing it to leverage third-party resources to act upon the conversations that you have with it.
# The value for these plugins is greatest when they help make up for a current short-coming that ChatGPT has.
# For example ChatGPT is built on top of GPT 4.0 which is a large language model which doesn‚Äôt understand mathematical and algebraic reasoning as well as it does written language
# and thus using the WolframAlpha plugin as a ‚Äúmath-mode‚Äù when needing to solve mathematical problems makes perfect sense!

# Another short-coming of ChatGPT we spoke about was that it lacks the use of context in answering your questions unless this context is specifically conveyed in the body of the prompt.
# The solution to this shortcoming was the [ChatGPT retrieval plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin) which connects ChatGPT to a vector database which provides a robust solution to the above problem.
# The vector database connected to ChatGPT can be used to store and refer to relevant information when answering prompts and acts as longterm memory of the LLM.

# Plugins are a very powerful way that you and I can contribute to improving LLM use-cases without having to retrain the underlying GPT model.
# Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre using ChatGPT and realize that it doesn't carry a conversation well enough when you ask it a question about the weather
# or it doesn‚Äôt have a specialized enough understanding of your health to suggest tasty and healthy recipes based on your previous blood sugar, pressure levels and health conditions.
# You can create a plugin to tackle these problems and in doing so improve usability for everyone since they can simply install your plugin and use it!

# The only questions then are **how do you get access to the exclusive plugin alpha** that OpenAI is running and **how do you go about creating a plugin for ChatGPT!?**
# Worry not, we come bearing good news on both notes üòÄ.

# Weaviate is partnering with OpenAI and Cortical Ventures to host a full-day [Generative AI Hackathon at ODSC East](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/generative-ai-hackathon-odsc-east-2023-tickets-616336738777) on May 11th in Boston at the Hynes Convention Center.
# There you will get access to the **OpenAI API** and **ChatGPT plugin tokens** that OpenAI is providing and you will be able to create your own plugins as well as AutoGPT-like apps to solve problems near and dear to your heart using tools like ChatGPT and Weaviate!
# You can register using the link provided above, slots are limited so don‚Äôt delay!

# Now getting to how you can create your own plugin for ChatGPT, here we will go through the step-by-step process of how we created the Weaviate Retrieval Plugin.
# The Weaviate retrieval plugin connects ChatGPT to an instance of Weaviate and allows it to query relevant documents from the vector database, upsert documents to ‚Äúremember‚Äù information for later and also delete documents to ‚Äúforget‚Äù them!
# The process that we took to create this plugin is quite similar to what one might take in creating a general plugin and thus we believe it‚Äôs quite instructive and we hope that it helps!

## How to Create a ChatGPT Plugin

# The entire code repository for the complete Weaviate Retrieval Plugin is located [here](https://github.com/weaviate/howto-weaviate-retrieval-plugin).
# Let‚Äôs go through the steps one-by-one including code snippets and some challenges we encountered and how we eventually solved them.

# The tech stack we used to develop this plugin is as follows:
# 1. Python: write everything in python
# 2. FastAPI: the server used to run the plugin
# 3. Pytest: to write and run our tests
# 4. Docker: we create containers to build, test and deploy the plugin

# Below are the steps we took to develop the plugin, Part 1 focuses on building a web application with our desired endpoint, Part 2 is specific to the development of a ChatGPT plugin while Part 3 is all about remote deployment using Fly.io.
# We cover the steps in order but feel free to skip steps depending on you level of comfort with the material.

## Part 1: Building a Web App

### Step 1: Setup the Development Environment

# To setup our development environment we used [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/).
# The `devcontainer.json` [file](https://github.com/weaviate/howto-weaviate-retrieval-plugin/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)  was updated by adding [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to it.
# You can find other dev container templates [here](https://containers.dev/templates).
