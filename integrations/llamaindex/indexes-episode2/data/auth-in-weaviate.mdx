 * Authentication is a crucial aspect of using Weaviate. This page provides an
 * overview of authentication in Weaviate, along with a series of videos that
 * explain the concepts and methods in detail.
 */

// Overview of authentication and its importance in Weaviate
/**
 * Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a client or user
 * before allowing access to a server or database. In Weaviate, authentication
 * is used to ensure that only authorized clients can access and modify data.
 */

// Conceptual diagram of sending a request with authentication credentials
/**
 * The diagram illustrates the process of sending a request with authentication
 * credentials. The client includes a "secret" (such as an API key or OIDC token)
 * in the request, which the server uses to verify the client's identity and
 * determine the level of access to grant.
 */

// Introduction to API key-based authentication in Weaviate
/**
 * We recently introduced an API key-based authentication method, which provides
 * a good balance of security and usability for many users. This page provides
 * an overview of all available authentication methods in Weaviate, including
 * anonymous access, API key authentication, and OIDC authentication.
