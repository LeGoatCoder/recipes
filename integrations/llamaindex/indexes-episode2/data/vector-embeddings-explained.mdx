# Title: Vector Embeddings Explained

# Semantic searches are searches based on the meaning or context of text or images,
# rather than exact keyword matches. For example, a search for "wine for seafood"
# should return a wine described as "good with fish", even though the keywords
# don't match exactly.

# Vector embeddings are a key component of semantic search. They are arrays of
# numbers that represent the meaning or context of a piece of text or image.
# By comparing the vector embeddings of different pieces of data, a search
# algorithm can determine how similar they are in meaning or context.

# Here's how semantic search using vector embeddings works:

# 1. When a new piece of data is added to the database, a vector embedding is
#    computed for it using a given model.

# 2. The embeddings are placed into an index, so that the database can quickly
#    perform searches.

# 3. For each query,
#    1. a vector embedding is computed using the same model that was used for
#       the data objects.
#    2. using a special algorithm, the database finds the closest vectors to
#       the given vector computed for the query.

# The quality of the search depends crucially on the quality of the model,
# while the speed of the search depends on the performance of the database.

# Vector embeddings can represent the meaning of text, images, audio, and other
# types of data. They are generated using machine learning models, which
# analyze the data and produce a vector of numbers that captures its meaning
# or context.

# The numbers in the vector embedding don't have a specific meaning on their own,
# but they can be used to determine the similarity of different pieces of data.

# For example, consider the following vector embeddings for the words "cat" and
# "kitty":

# cat = [1.5, -0.4, 7.2, 19.6, 3.1, ..., 20.2]
# kitty = [1.5, -0.4, 7.2, 19.5, 3.2, ..., 20.8]

# These two vectors are very similar, indicating that "cat" and "kitty" have
# similar meanings. In contrast, vectors for "banjo" or "comedy" would not be
# very similar to either of these vectors.

# Weaviate is a vector database that can be used to store and search data using
# vector embeddings. It supports many different vectorizer models and vectorizer
# service providers, and can even be configured to use custom vectors.

# For example, Weaviate can use Hugging Face models, OpenAI, Cohere, or transformer
# models to generate vector embeddings for text data. It can also use the CLIP
# model to convert images and text to vectors in the same vector space.

# By using vector embeddings to represent the meaning of data, Weaviate makes
# it possible to perform semantic searches that can find relevant data even
# when the exact keywords are not present.
