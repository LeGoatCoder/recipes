The Weaviate Cloud enables AI application developers to use the open source Weaviate vector database as a fully managed cloud service. It’s the easiest way to get a vector database cluster up and running within minutes, so you can get right to loading, vectorizing, and searching your data.

## Thanks for all the early feedback!

During the Weaviate Cloud private beta, we had several thousand people create free Weaviate Cloud sandboxes and try it out. We’d like to thank everyone who tried it and gave us feedback; it was extremely helpful. We look forward to hearing about your experience with the new (and future versions), which you can still [try for free here](https://console.weaviate.cloud/).

## The Weaviate Cloud Service Public Beta
Here’s a quick overview of what’s new and what’s coming next.

### Help yourself - Self-Service Provisioning Improvements
One of the biggest changes from the private beta to today’s public beta release is automated Weaviate database cluster provisioning. Immediately after signing up for a Weaviate Cloud account, you can begin creating, querying, securing, and controlling one or more databases via the Weaviate Cloud console. As a result of the automation improvements, newly created Weaviate database clusters will be ready for use within a minute or two.
