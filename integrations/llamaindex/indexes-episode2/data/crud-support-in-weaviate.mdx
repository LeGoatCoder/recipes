Title: Weaviate, a vector database with ANN Index and CRUD support

This code provides an overview of Weaviate, a cloud-native, modular, real-time vector database
built to scale machine learning models. Weaviate supports both traditional CRUD operations and
vector search capabilities, making it a powerful tool for large-scale machine learning
applications.
"""

# Introduction ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

"""
The introduction provides context for the need of vector databases in machine learning
applications. It explains the limitations of brute-force comparison methods for vector
similarity searches and the benefits of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) models.
"""

# Overview ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"""
The overview section outlines the topics that will be covered in the article, including:
- How ANN models enable fast and large-scale vector searches
- Where popular ANN libraries fall short
- What Weaviate is and how it can bring your vector search needs to production
- A glimpse of how Weaviate works under the hood
"""

# What is Weaviate? ---------------------------------------------------------------------

"""
This section provides a brief overview of what Weaviate is, including its modularity,
vectorization capabilities, and support for various media types.
"""

# When do you call a database a database? ----------------------------------------------

"""
This section outlines the key principles of a database, including CRUD, real-time
capabilities, mutability, persistence, and consistency.
"""

# Popular ANN libraries fall short of many of the above principles -----------------------

"""
This section explains how popular ANN libraries, such as Annoy and ScaNN, fall short in
terms of real-time capabilities and mutability.
"""

# Weaviate overcomes the limitations of ANN libraries ------------------------------------

"""
This section explains how Weaviate overcomes the limitations of ANN libraries by providing
real-time querying capabilities, full CRUD support, and persistence.
"""

# How can Weaviate achieve all of this? --------------------------------------------------

"""
This section explains how Weaviate's modularity and custom HNSW implementation allow it to
provide real-time querying, full CRUD support, and persistence.
"""

# Choose what's right for your use case --------------------------------------------------

"""
This section provides guidance on when to choose a library like Annoy or ScaNN versus
Weaviate, based on the specific needs of the use case.
"""

# Additional resources ------------------------------------------------------------------

"""
This section provides links to additional resources, including the quickstart guide,
documentation, and GitHub repository.
