## New Filter Operators

Weaviate's core functionality includes index structures for finding data objects quickly. The ability to combine an inverted index with a vector index is what makes Weaviate powerful. The new filter operators allow filtering data based on null values or array lengths.

### Filtering Null Values

When dealing with large datasets, it is common to have objects with missing or null properties. With Weaviate 1.16, you can query the `null` state, which applies to both scenarios where a property is set to `null` or the property is completely missing.

#### Stage 1: Importing Null Value

When importing data into Weaviate, either with missing properties or with properties set to `null`, Weaviate will import the objects and set the index (for the missing/null properties) values to `null`.

#### Stage 2: Indexing Null Values

Indexing null values is optional and can be configured in the schema for a class to track if a property within a class is `null` or not.

#### Stage 3: Filtering for Specific Property State

With the new `IsNull` operator, you can perform queries that are filtered by the null state, allowing you to find all objects that miss a specific property or find only those that have the property populated.

## Distributed Backups

Weaviate 1.15 introduced backup functionality, but it had one limitation: you couldn't backup objects stored in multi-shard configuration across multiple nodes. With Weaviate 1.16, multi-sharded classes stored in a Weaviate cluster can be completely backed up, allowing for a robust and safe way to restore objects when required.

---

## Ref2Vec Centroid Module

The new `ref2vec-centroid` module uses the average, or centroid vector, of the cross-referenced vectors to represent the referencing object. This allows for applications in recommendation, knowledge graph representation, and representing long or complex multimodal objects.

---

## Node Status API

The new node API endpoint allows you to check in on the health of your running clusters quickly, displaying the current state of your clusters and notifying you if any nodes are disconnected or unhealthy.

---

## More Powerful OIDC Auth

Weaviate supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, providing a convenient and secure single sign-on. With Weaviate 1.16, Azure-based OIDC authentication is now supported, allowing Weaviate to authenticate users based on their Azure Active Directory (AD) credentials.

## Patch Releases Ready Sooner

Starting with Weaviate 1.15, new patch releases are published as soon as new important fixes are available, giving you access to the latest and greatest as soon as possible.
