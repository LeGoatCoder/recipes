# What is Sphere?
The Sphere dataset is an open-source knowledge base released by Meta, consisting of 134 million documents (906 million 100-word snippets). It aims to act as a universal, uncurated, and unstructured source of knowledge for solving knowledge-intensive natural language tasks such as question-answering and fact-checking.

# The Challenges of using Sphere
The Sphere dataset is challenging to access and use for the average developer due to its large size. The smallest open-sourced sparse Sphere indices file is 833 Gigabytes in its compressed format, and using it for hybrid search testing and benchmarking requires significant effort.

# The Sphere Dataset in Weaviate
To make this powerful resource accessible, the Sphere dataset is now available in Weaviate, JSON, or Parquet files. It can be easily imported with Python and Spark for vectorized search.

# Importing Sphere with Python
You can import the Sphere dataset into Weaviate using the Python Client and the dpr-question_encoder-single-nq-base model. We provide dataset files ranging from 100K to 899M lines.

1. Install the Weaviate Client.
2. Download and unpack a dataset file.
3. Import the dataset into Weaviate with Python.




# Importing Sphere with Spark
If you want to train large language models for knowledge-intensive tasks on Sphere, you can use Apache Spark. Weaviate's Python Client and the Weaviate Spark connector make it easy to load data from Spark to Weaviate.

1. Prepare a Spark dataframe with Sphere data.
2. Import the dataframe into Weaviate using the Weaviate Spark connector.

# Searching through Sphere with Weaviate
Once the Sphere dataset is in Weaviate, you can use it with all the functionality that comes with Weaviate, such as hybrid search.
