## üîß Reliability fixes and improvements

At Weaviate, reliability is one of our core values. We strive to make our software dependable, bug-free, and behaving as expected. In this release, we've focused on bug fixing and reliability improvements. Here are some highlights:

### üêõ Critical bug fix in compaction logic

In this release, we fixed a critical bug that, in rare situations, could result in data loss. This bug affected environments with frequent updates and deletes.

> This bug fix alone makes it worth upgrading to Weaviate 1.14.

#### Background

We found a critical error in the compaction logic that could lead to the compaction operation either corrupting or completely losing data elements.

#### Example

Imagine you have an object with id: **my-id-123456**. Calling the following GraphQL API with a filter on id would return the expected object.




However, calling the following REST API with the same id wouldn't get the object back.



#### The problem

If your data manipulation logic depended on the above operations to perform as expected, your update and delete operations might have been issued incorrectly.

### üöÄ Improved performance for large scale data imports

Weaviate `1.14` significantly improves the performance of data imports for large datasets.

Note that the performance improvements should be noticeable for imports of over 10 million objects. Furthermore, this update enables you to import over 200 million objects into the database.

#### Problem

Before, the HNSW index would grow in constant intervals of 25,000 objects. This was fine for datasets under 25 million objects. But once the database got to around 25 million objects, adding new objects would be significantly slower. Then from 50‚Äì100m, the import process would slow down to a walking pace.

#### Solution

To address this problem, we changed how the HNSW index grows. We implemented a relative growth pattern, where the HNSW index size increases by either 25% or 25'000 objects (whichever is bigger).

#### Test

After introducing the relative growth patterns, we've run a few tests. We were able to import 200 million objects and more, while the import performance remained constant throughout the process.

### ‚è≥ Drastically improved Mean-Time-To-Recovery (MTTR)

Weaviate `1.14` fixes an issue where a crash-recovery could take multiple minutes, or even hours in some extreme cases. It is now a matter of just seconds. So even in the rare event that your instance crashes, it will come back up very quickly.

#### Problem

If Weaviate encounters an unexpected crash, no data will be lost. To provide this guarantee, a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is in place. If a crash had occurred, the WAL is parsed at startup, and all previously unfinished operations are recovered, even if they were part of in-memory structures that had not yet been flushed. While this system is very safe, the recovery could be slow for several reasons:

- Unflushed memtables could become very large. This would lead to a lot of data that needs to be recovered after a crash
- The recovery process was single-threaded. If multiple recoveries were required, they would happen in sequence. On a large machine, this could mean that startup would be slow, yet only one of many CPU cores was utilized.
- The data structure used to hold the recovered items was never intended to hold many items. Each additional insertion would degrade its performance. As a result, the larger the WAL to recover, the slower the recovery would become.

#### Solution

We addressed each of the points above individually and improved the overall MTTR substantially:

- A deduplication process was added, so that large WALs with a lot of updates (i.e. redundant data) could be reduced to only the necessary information.
- The recovery process now runs in parallel. If there are multiple places that require recovery, they can each recover independently, without one recovery having to wait for the other.
- A mechanism was added that flushes any memtable that has been idle (no writes) for 60s or more. In addition to speeding up the recovery, this change also ensures that no recovery is needed at all in many cases.

#### Test

We designed an extreme stress test that would represent the "worst-case" scenario for recovery. It has multiple very large, independent Write-Ahead Logs that required for recovery. Before, this could take many hours to recover, while now it takes only a few seconds.
