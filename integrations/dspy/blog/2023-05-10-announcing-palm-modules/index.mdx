<!---
This is a blog post announcing the integration of Google's PaLM API with Weaviate through two new modules.
--->

We are thrilled to announce two brand new Weaviate modules that will help you to get the most out Google's new PaLM large language model (LLM).

<!---
Modules have since been renamed to `text2vec-google` and `generative-google`.
--->

These new modules are:
- [`text2vec-palm`](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-palm) for generating vector embeddings and running semantic (`nearText`) queries, and
- [`generative-palm`](/developers/weaviate/modules/reader-generator-modules/generative-palm) for generative search.

<!---
These modules are available to all Weaviate users as of **today**, with the release of Weaviate version `v1.19.1`.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-face-thinking"></i> What is PaLM?

The Pathways Language Model (or `PaLM`) is Googleâ€™s own LLM. According to Google, PaLM was designed to generalize across domains and tasks while being highly efficient.

You can read more about PaLM in the following resources:
- [Google blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html)
- [Research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311)

Some highlights of PaLM are:
- Contains 540-billion parameters
- Is a dense decoder-only Transformer model
- Was trained using a combination of English and multilingual datasets

Don't take our word for it - take a look at these [demo snippets from Google's blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html).

> Edit: We now have more details on the PaLM 2 family of models, which the API is based on! [Read about it here](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/). In the blog, Google especially highlights improvements in multilingual, reasoning and coding capabilities.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> What can the Vertex PaLM API do?

Being an LLM, PaLM can perform numerous tasks, from question-answering, sentence-completion, reading comprehension tasks, common-sense reasoning tasks and more.

Additionally, it can perform multi-lingual NLP tasks reflecting its dataset. What's more, you can use Google's Vertex AI PaLM API to test, customize, and deploy instances of Google's LLMs.

In other words, you can not only use PaLM off-the-shelf, but also customize the foundation model to suit **your** needs.
