# Weaviate 1.16 Release

## New Filter Operators
- Allows filtering of data based on null values or array lengths

### Filtering Null Values
- New `IsNull` operator to check if a given property is set to `null` or not
- Applies to both scenarios where a property is set to `null` or the property is completely missing
- Changes at three different stages of working with data in Weaviate:
  1. Importing Null Value:
    - When you import data into Weaviate, either with missing properties or with properties set to `null` - in both cases, Weaviate will do two things:
      - Import the objects and skip the missing/null properties
