<h1>UK-based startup Moonsift is harnessing the power of AI to help online shoppers discover the products they love</h1>

<p>Moonsift is a browser extension that allows users to curate shoppable boards with products from across the internet. Stylists and curators use Moonsift to create collections, registries, and wish lists that can be shared and shopped with a simple link. The company has a bigger vision for improving product discoverability for online shoppers.</p>

<h2>Collecting data to enable understanding</h2>

<p>In order to create a comprehensive AI shopping copilot, Moonsift needed product data from retailers along with cross-retailer shopping data to enable understanding of the discovery process and train machine learning models. They have been collecting this data through usage of their browser extension over the last few years. This data includes over 60M products, 250M interactions, and 40K retailers across the internet. Now, Moonsift has the data they need (which is growing every day) to improve product discovery with AI.</p>

<h2>Building the discovery engine</h2>

<p>Marcel Marais, lead machine learning engineer at Moonsift, was tasked with building a system that could harness the data they've gathered to take their product to the next level. Marais decided to implement semantic search, a system that could interpret a user’s intent rather than rely on exact keyword matches. He also needed a system that could index and search multimodal (text and image) data across millions of objects.</p>

<h2>Selecting Weaviate as the vector database of choice</h2>

<p>After evaluating several open and closed-source vector databases, the team decided that Weaviate was the best-fit solution for their needs. They cited the following reasons for choosing Weaviate: open source, comprehensive documentation and support for popular LLMs and multi-modal models, direct integration of machine learning models, advanced monitoring and replication capabilities, high query throughput at scale, and unique search features to drive performance and efficiency.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>Moonsift is now getting ready to launch their AI Copilot to the world. They are also exploring ways to optimize the cost, performance, and scale of their system by using Weaviate’s new feature, Product Quantization (PQ), and multi-tenancy.</p>
