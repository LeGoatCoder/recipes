# Introduction

This markdown file provides an overview of Weaviate, a vector database that supports CRUD operations and Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) indexing. The article highlights the limitations of popular ANN libraries and explains how Weaviate addresses these issues.

# Vector Search and ANN Libraries

The article begins by discussing the importance of vector search in machine learning applications and the limitations of popular ANN libraries. ANN libraries, such as Annoy and faiss, make a trade-off between accuracy and retrieval speed, enabling users to retrieve the closest vectors within a few milliseconds. However, these libraries fall short in terms of features and functionality compared to traditional databases and search engines.

# Weaviate: A Vector Database

Weaviate is a cloud-native, modular, real-time vector database that addresses the limitations of popular ANN libraries. It is designed to scale machine learning models and supports CRUD operations, making it a fully functional database.

# What Defines a Database?

The article then discusses the key principles that define a database, including CRUD, real-time capabilities, mutability, persistence, and consistency.

# Popular ANN Libraries Fall Short

The biggest downside of ANN libraries is their real-time capabilities and mutability. Libraries, such as Annoy or ScaNN, require all data objects to be imported upfront, followed by a build period to build up the index. Once the index is built, it is read-only, making it impossible to update or delete objects.

# Weaviate Overcomes ANN Libraries' Limitations

Weaviate addresses the limitations of ANN libraries by providing real-time capabilities, full CRUD support, and persistence. Any object imported into Weaviate can be queried immediately, and objects can be updated, deleted, or added at any time.

# How Weaviate Achieves Full CRUD Support

Weaviate achieves full CRUD support by using a custom HNSW implementation that extends existing libraries with more features. Each write is added to a write-ahead log, and inserts into HNSW are made mutable by assigning an immutable document ID. If an object is altered, Weaviate deletes the old doc id, assigns a new one, and reimports the object into the vector index.

# Conclusion

The article concludes by summarizing the limitations of popular ANN libraries and explaining how Weaviate addresses these issues. It encourages readers to choose the right solution for their use case and try out Weaviate.
