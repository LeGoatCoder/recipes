<h1>Running Large Language Models Privately - privateGPT and Beyond</h1>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore some of the different potential approaches organizations can take to ensure robust data privacy while harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs).</p>

## Understanding the Privacy Challenge

<p>LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, which can often contain sensitive information. The traditional approach of relying on cloud-based services to deploy and conduct inference with these models requires organizations to transfer their data to third-party centralized model providers, leading to privacy concerns.</p>

## Potential Solutions to the Privacy Challenge

### Federated Learning

<p>Federated Learning enables model training without directly accessing or transferring user data. Instead, individual edge devices or servers collaboratively train the model while keeping the data local. This approach ensures that sensitive data remains private, reducing the risk of data breaches during model fine-tuning on custom data.</p>

### Homomorphic Encryption

<p>Homomorphic encryption (HE) allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. It is a powerful tool for preserving privacy in scenarios where sensitive data needs to be processed or analyzed while maintaining confidentiality. This technique can be applied to LLMs, enabling private inference while preserving the confidentiality of user inputs.</p>

### Locally Deployed LLMs

<p>Running open-source LLMs locally is a practical solution for organizations to more securely leverage the power of LLMs on their own proprietary documents, all in the privacy of their on-prem or hybrid servers. Preliminary solutions like privateGPT and h2oGPT allow you to deploy LLMs locally, including the famous LLaMA model from Meta.</p>

## Locally Running LLMs With Custom Data

<p>To run OSS LLMs locally with custom data, you can store the documents that you want to use to provide the LLM custom context in a vector database. This enables the LLM to look up and retrieve the relevant documents and consume them to learn more context prior to generating a prompt. This process is known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG).</p>

## Advantages and Disadvantages of a Local/Private Setup

<p>The advantages of locally deploying your vector database and LLM models include data privacy guarantees, reduced attack surface, and compliance with data protection and privacy regulations. However, a RAG stack running locally is constrained by the compute and resources available, and requires investment in high-performance hardware and technical expertise.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As we move forward, it is crucial for the AI community to continue prioritizing privacy and security, ensuring that LLMs can be deployed in a manner that respects individual privacy rights.</p>
