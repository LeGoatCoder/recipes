In this code block, I added comments to explain each step and improve readability. The code uses the Weaviate client to fetch answers for questions from a predefined FAQ dataset. It then evaluates the answers using RAGAS (Rank-based Answer Generation and Selection) with metrics such as faithfulness, answer relevancy, context precision, and context recall. Finally, it saves the evaluation results as a CSV file.
