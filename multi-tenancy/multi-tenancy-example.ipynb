# üóÇÔ∏è Multi-Tenancy in Weaviate
# 
# Welcome to this demo notebook! Here, we'll walk you through a small example showcasing the `Multi-Tenancy` function in Weaviate.
# Multi-tenancy is a key feature in Weaviate, allowing for the efficient and secure management of data across multiple users or tenants.
#
# üìñ Further Reading:
# 
# - Explore the concept in depth in the [multi-tenancy blog post](https://weaviate.io/blog/multi-tenancy-vector-search).
# - Dive into the technical details in our [Weaviate developer documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/multi-tenancy#enable-multitenancy).
#
# ## Getting started
# Before we dive in, there are a few preliminary steps:
#
# 1. Set Up a Weaviate Cluster: 
# This notebook requires a working Weaviate cluster. If you don't have one, fret not! You can set up a free sandbox Weaviate cluster by following our [comprehensive guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/hello_weaviate/set_up).
#
# 2. Virtual Environment and Dependencies: 
# To ensure smooth execution and prevent potential conflicts with your global Python environment, we recommend running the code in a virtual environment. Later in this notebook, we'll guide you through setting up this environment and installing the necessary dependencies.
#
# With these points in mind, let's get started!

# ## Dependencies
#
# Before proceeding with the notebook content, it's essential to set up an isolated Python environment. This helps avoid any potential package conflicts and ensures that you have a clean workspace.
#
# ### Virtual Environment Setup:
#
# If you haven't created a virtual environment before, here's how you can do it:
#
# Using `virtualenv`:
#
# ```bash
# pip install virtualenv
# python -m virtualenv venv
# ```
#
# Using `venv` (built-in with Python 3.3+):
#
# ```bash
# python -m venv venv
# ```
#
# After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it:
#
# Windows:
#
# ```bash
# .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
# ```
#
# macOS and Linux:
#
# ```bash
# source venv/bin/activate
# ```
#
# ### Installing Dependencies:
#
# With the virtual environment active, run the following code to install all the required dependencies for this notebook:

!pip install weaviate-client

# ## Connecting to Your Weaviate Cluster
#
# To interact with our Weaviate cluster, we'll initialize a client object. Once set up, we'll retrieve the current schemas as a way to verify the connection. Since the cluster is newly created, we expect that no schemas will be present.

import weaviate

client = weaviate.Client(
  url="WEAVIATE-INSTANCE-URL",  # URL of your Weaviate instance
  auth_client_secret=weaviate.AuthApiKey(api_key="AUTH-KEY"), # (Optional) If the Weaviate instance requires authentication
)

client.schema.delete_all() # Delete all data
is_valid = len(client.schema.get()["classes"]) == 0
print(is_valid)

# ## Setting Up Multi-Tenancy in a Weaviate Class
#
# In Weaviate, multi-tenancy allows for multiple tenants to securely access and manage data within the same schema. Let's proceed to define a new class that utilizes this feature:
#
# ### Define a Multi-Tenancy Enabled Class:
#
# We'll start by creating a class named 'MultiTenancyClass' with the multi-tenancy feature activated.

from weaviate import Tenant

client.schema.create_class({
    'class': 'MultiTenancyClass',
    'multiTenancyConfig': {'enabled': True}
})

# ### Add Multiple Tenants to the Class:
#
# After establishing the class, we'll associate it with two tenants: 'tenantA' and 'tenantB'

client.schema.add_class_tenants(
  class_name='MultiTenancyClass',  # The class to which the tenants will be added
  tenants=[Tenant(name='tenantA'), Tenant(name='tenantB')]
)

# ## Fetching Tenants from a Weaviate Class
#
# To view the tenants associated with a specific class, we can retrieve a list of all the tenants linked to it. Let's do this for our previously created class, 'MultiTenancyClass':

tenants = client.schema.get_class_tenants(
    class_name='MultiTenancyClass'  # The class from which the tenants will be retrieved
)

print(tenants)
is_valid = len(tenants) == 2
print(is_valid)

# ## Assigning Data Objects to Specific Tenants
#
# In Weaviate, data objects can be associated with specific tenants in a multi-tenancy enabled class. Here, we will demonstrate how to create data objects and link them to their respective tenants:

object_a = client.data_object.create(
      class_name='MultiTenancyClass',  # The class to which the object will be added
      data_object={
          'text': 'This belongs to TenantA'
      },
      tenant='tenantA'  # The tenant to which the object will be added
)

# First object
object_b_1 = client.data_object.create(
      class_name='MultiTenancyClass',  # The class to which the object will be added
      data_object={
          'text': 'This belongs to TenantB'
      },
      tenant='tenantB'  # The tenant to which the object will be added
)

# Second object
object_b_2 = client.data_object.create(
      class_name='MultiTenancyClass',  # The class to which the object will be added
